<h2>Autonomous Robotics</h2>
 
<td class="b">
<p><h3 style="padding-top: 0.55em;">Professor</h3><a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke</a>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Tuesday and Thursday, 10:30 to 11:45 AM, in Room L008 of the Art and Design Building.

<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3> CS 310, 262, and 203.  Be warned that this will be a difficult course.

<p><h3>About the Class</h3>This course will cover a variety of topics in autonomous robotics, including but not limited to: basics in robot hardware, kinematics, dynamics and controls, agent architectures and behavior-based robotics, sensing and locomotion, planning, and multirobotics.

<p>The course will involve projects working directly with robots of different kinds.  Depending on class size, such projects may or may not be done by teams.  The primary programming language will be C (or basic C++); but other languages will be used and you are expected to be able to come up to speed rapidly with languages you are unfamiliar with (such as Lua).

<p><h3>Texts</h3>At present there is no text: however things may change before the class begins. 

<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/cs485/">http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/cs485/</a> 
 
<p><h3>Grading</h3> 

This course will consist of homework and projects, possibly including a final project, and two non-cumulative exams. The breakdown will be approximately:

<table border=0 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td valign=top>Homework&nbsp;and&nbsp;Projects
<td valign=top>50% with higher weight given to harder projects 
<tr><td valign=top>Exams
<td valign=top>25% Each
</table>

There will be no make-up tests for missed examinations. Penalties for lateness are severe.  Late homework will be accepted but at a loss of 20% per day (homework later than 4 days, or after the last day of class, is worth nothing).



 
<P><h3>Honor Code</h3> The class enforces the <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science. You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.
 
 
<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.
