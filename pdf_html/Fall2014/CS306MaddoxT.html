<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is
intended to help students become effective professionals in the field
of computer science by examining many of the challenging legal and
ethical issues surrounding computer technology and its use, and
building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. Students will
examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how to
apply them to issues raised by computers and technology. Specific
topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns, will
be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner. Emerging legal
and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce
will also be addressed. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, students will be expected to apply
critical thinking skills in individual and group settings to evaluate
various issues related to computer law and ethics. Students will
connect issues of technology to wider societal concerns through class
discussion, a mock trial, and in-class activities. Students will use
critical thinking skills to evaluate and prepare formal arguments
concerning their assigned mock trial topics, which they will present to
their classmates. Students should be prepared to participate during
class activities, to interact with their classmates, and to reflect
upon and refine their personal points of view on various ethical
issues. </p>
