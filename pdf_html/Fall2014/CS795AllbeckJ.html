<h3>Description: </h3>
<p>This course will discuss both the fundamentals of game design and active 
research areas in game design and development. Each week, the instructor will 
present some fundamentals of game design. Then a member of the class will lead a 
discussion on the assigned research papers. Everyone will be expected to read 
2-4 assigned research papers per week. Research topics will cover the main areas 
of game design and development, but can vary somewhat to adapt to the class's 
interests. In addition to class participation, everyone will be expected to 
complete a semester long course project. The project can result in an 
implementation or a paper. More information on the project requirements will be 
given during the first class.&nbsp; </p>
