<h3>
Overview </h3>
This course conveys key concepts for designing and building distributed software systems.
The course is geared towards software engineers that work mostly at the application-level, 
but need to understand the features and limitations of existing middleware for 
distributed systems.  
Additionally, the course covers some research topics related to currently open problems. 
Specifically, some of the topic that will be covered are as follows: 
definition and scope of distribution, 
principles of communication and computation, 
socket programming, 
remote method invocation, 
software architecture of distributed systems, 
middleware systems, service discovery, quality of service, 
adaptive systems, mobility, security, and fault tolerance.
