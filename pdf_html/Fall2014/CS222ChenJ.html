<p><b>DESCRIPTION:    </b>CS 222 is a second course in computer programming,

       emphasizing programming concepts relevant to engineers. Topics include

    lower   level language aspects and elementary data structures.  Students

   are expected   to have a basic understanding of the elements of programming

   in some high-level   language.  CS 222 will be taught using C, but students

   are not presumed to  be familiar with C prior to this class.   This course

   is intended as a terminal  course in programming for engineers.</p>

                           

<p><i>Prerequisite:  C or better in CS 112.</i> </p>

                                      

<hr>                         

<p> <strong>COURSE POLICIES</strong></p>
<p><em>Class:</em> Students are expected to attend all lectures   each    week  and are responsible for all material covered during lecture.</p>
<p>Electronic Devices: &nbsp; Use  of electronic devices (including laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.)  is not permitted during class. &nbsp;Please make sure all such devices  are turned off or silenced while class is in session. </p>
<p><em>Programming Assignments:</em> Programming assignments will be posted         on Blackboard as they are assigned, and must be submitted on Blackboard       by  the assigned due date.  If your program is incomplete, you may still      submit  it for partial credit.  However, <strong>your code must run without   obvious   errors  (even if not all functionality is present)</strong>.  Building   your programs     in  a modular fashion and debugging as you go are crucial   concepts in program     development.  Additionally, your TA relies on running   your program as part    of your grade determination. <strong>Accordingly, any   programming assignment    that is submitted but either does not compile or   has major errors when it   is run will receive no more than 50% credit.</strong></p>
<p>Students are expected to work independently outside of class to familiarize         themselves with the GMU computer systems, to read and review all assigned         materials and to complete all homework and programming projects. </p>
<p><em>Reading</em>: Students are responsible for reading and  understanding all assigned material. Be aware that some material  covered in class may not be found in your textbook. &nbsp;If you do not  understand any of the covered materal or reading assignments, there  will be opportunities to ask questions in class, on Blackboard or  during  UTA/GTA/instructor office hours. </p>
<p><em>Due Dates</em>: Due dates for all programming projects will be  posted on Blackboard. Programming assignments are posted in advance,  and  are due in the manner stated in the specs (usually electronic  submission  through Blackboard) no later than the date specified. &nbsp;Homework  assignments are due in the manner stated (either through Blackboard or  in class.) </p>
<p><em>Late work</em>: &nbsp;No late submissions are permitted for homework assignments. &nbsp;Late submissions are permitted for programming projects,&nbsp;but will be penalized 10% per day (incl. weekend         days/holidays).  You should recognize that this can cause major penalties         for incomplete programs, so start work early!  If your program isn't    the    way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near, submit it anyway    for  partial   credit. <strong>In fact, submit early and often! </strong> The system    permits  you to&nbsp;resubmit your assignment until the due date,    so you may  resubmit if you improve your program prior to the deadline.   (Resubmissions  after the deadline require approval of your TA, since s/he   may already have  graded your project.  If you know that you wish to resubmit   a new version  after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your   TA no later than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time   submission.)   No resubmissions may be made after a project has been graded. </p>

                                      

<hr><b>GRADING POLICY</b>                             

<p>Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following items: </p>

                              

<ul>

               <tt>

  <li>programming projects (25%)</li>
  <li>Homework (10%)</li>
  </tt>  <tt>

  <li>class participation  (20%)</li>

                </tt>  <tt>

  <li>two midterm exams (20%)</li>

                </tt>  <tt>
                <li>final examination                (25%)</li>

                </tt>
</ul>

                              

<p>Class participation  may include in-class exercises, pop quizzes, and/or

  short programming. </p>

                             

<p> </p>

                                      

<hr><b>CLASS COMMUNICATIONS</b>                             

<p>CS 222 will be using the Blackboard system for most class communications. 

       You are responsible for any notifications or information posted on 

Blackboard      either by your instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s), and

you will  need    to check Blackboard regularly for such notices.  Some information

 may be   disseminated through Blackboard rather than in class.  Individual

 communications   with the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by email using your

 GMU email account.    When you email, please be sure to include your name,

 the class number and   the topic in the subject header.  (E.g.:  Subject:

 Jim Jones / CS 222 / Project  2) </p>

                                         

<hr>
<strong>PROGRAMMING POLICIES</strong>
<p>(1) <strong>No sharing or discussion of code for assignments</strong>.&nbsp;Unless specifically stated         otherwise, all assignments are individual projects, not group projects.       Students  are expected to do their own work, not to share programs with     each  other,  nor copy programs from anyone else.  This means you may  not    discuss  program  design or strategize solutions with anyone except  your   instructor  or a course  UTA or GTA.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;However,  you may offer  more limited assistance to your fellow students regarding specific  questions on their programming assignments by responding to queries on  Blackboard or Piazza (see guidelines below). &nbsp;You may also discuss  general course concepts, including coding, so long as it is&nbsp;  outside of any assignment context. &nbsp;Any discussion or sharing of code outside these guidelines constitutes  an honor code violation.  Suspected   honor code violations are  taken very seriously, and will be reported to  the Honor Committee. (See <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/StatementOnAcademicIntegrity">CS  Department Integrity Statement</a> and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">Honor Code</a>) </p>
<p>(2) <strong>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</strong><em>.</em> You may <u>not</u> incorporate code written by others, such as can be found on the  Internet or any of the numerous CS books available. You are encouraged  to use external sources to enhance your understanding of general  concepts, but you should not be using these sources to locate code to  include in any assigned programs. &nbsp;Of course, you  may freely use any code provided as part of the project specifications,  and you need not credit the source. &nbsp;However, if you use code  provided by your instructor/GTA/UTA (other than that given as part of  the project  specifications) or from the course textbook, you must document what  portion came from those sources. &nbsp;Working something out together  with an instructor or TA usually will not require crediting the source,  but when in doubt, sinply ask to make sure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(3) <strong>Blackboard/Piazza</strong>.  We encourage the use of Blackboard to discuss         assignments and assist one another with programming questions.  You   may    ask  questions or respond to queries on Blackboard regarding projects   or   other  assignments, <strong>so long as you do not post any C code or detailed     pseudocode,  and so long as you do not provide specific solutions to the    overall problem  or algorithm design (even in English)</strong>.  Often, students    believe that "simple" code is acceptable to place on Blackboard.  However,    because there is a wide variation in what different students and instructors    regard as "simple," we must be very strict about the ban against Blackboard    code. <strong>Only</strong> an instructor, GTA or UTA is permitted to place code  on  blackboard unless it is code that has already been provided to all students    (either as part of the assignment specification itself or within the class    textbook). </p>
<p>(4) <strong>Discussing Blackboard/Piazza postings outside of Blackboard/Piazza.</strong> &nbsp;Students must not discuss postings from Blackboard/Piazza outside of the electronic system. &nbsp;"Summarizing"  Blackboard statements or responses to another student  verbally regarding an assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject  to the above ban on discussing assignment solutions. While it may seem  harmless, Blackboard and Piazza were set up so that all assistance  could be overseen  by instructors/TAs/UTAs, and it is nearly impossible to truly duplicate  this type of discussion outside of the system itself, thus creating the  potential  for either (unknown) mistaken advice, or for unfair advantage by  certain  students. If you truly wish to assist a fellow student, encourage him  or  her to log onto Blackboard/Piazza, and direct him/her to specific  postings you  find helpful. </p>
<p>(5) <strong>Back up your program regularly.</strong> You are expected to backup         your program in separate files as you get different pieces working.   Failure      to do this may result in your getting a much lower grade on a  program  if   last minute problems occur.  (Accidently deleting your program,   having  problems    connecting, etc., will <u>not</u> be accepted as excuses.) </p>
<p>(6) <strong>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</strong>.  It  is important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final  submission.  If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit  will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not changed  after being submitted. </p>
<p>(7) <strong>Code must run on either Zeus or Mason gcc</strong>.  Students may develop         programs using any computer system they have available. Please note,    however,     that submitted projects must run under a C compiler available    either on   Zeus or Mason.  Your documentation should clearly state which    software was   used for compilation, and once makefiles are introduced, a   makefile should  be included with each assignment  submission. <u>No extensions</u> will be given due to compiler incompatibilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong><br>
  GMU is an Honor Code university; please see the University Catalog for a full       description of the code and the honor committee process. The principle of academic       integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely. What does       academic integrity mean in this course? Essentially this: when you are responsible       for a task, you will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&rsquo;s work       in an aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the       proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free play       of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this course, with       the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be conducted with civility       and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt       (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.<br>
</p>
<p><strong> GMU EMAIL ACCOUNTS</strong><br>
  Students must activate their GMU email accounts to receive important University       information, including messages related to this class. You should understand       that your emailbox may be full, so check your email and make sure you have enough       space daily. <br>
