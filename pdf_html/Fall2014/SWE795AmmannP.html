SWE 795: Advanced Testing Techniques
<br>
Fall 2014

<h3>
Course Description</h3>
This version of SWE 795 is about advanced testing techniques. 
I will focus on two (very different) areas where I am actively involved in research:
Mutation testing, and
Testing to support usable security.
I expect that most students will choose to work in one of these areas, but it is also possible, with instructor approval, to focus on a different advanced testing technique.
