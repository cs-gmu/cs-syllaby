<p><h3>Textbook</h3>
The text is Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, The C Programming Language, 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 1988.
<p><h3>About the Class</h3> Most high-level programming languages (and particularly Java) insulate the programmer from the realities of the hardware on which the programs will run. C is the exception since it was originally designed to implement the Unix operating system. C offers the programmer direct access to much of the underlying hardware and, for programs running under Unix, direct access to operating system services. For these reasons C remains the language of choice for systems programming.
<br><br>
This is a (short) course on "low-level" programming using C. We will learn C with heavy emphasis on pointer operations.

<p><H3>Topics</H3>

<P>Planned topics include:
<UL>
<LI>C Types, Operators, and Expressions</LI>
<LI>Control Flow</LI>
<LI>Functions and Program Structures</LI>
<LI>Pointers and Arrays</LI>
<LI>Dynamic memory allocation</LI>
<LI>Structures</LI>
<LI>Bitwise operations</LI>
<LI>Input and Output Libraries</LI>
<LI>The Unix System Interface</LI>
<LI>File I/O
</UL> 

<H3>Course outcomes</H3>

<P>
The students will:
</P><UL>
<LI>Be able to implement, test and debug a designed solution to a problem in a 
low-level programming language, specifically the C programming language.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate a good understanding of C language constructs such as pointers,
dynamic memory management, and address arithmetic.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate a good understanding of C libraries for input and output, and the
interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate an ability to use UNIX tools for program development and
debugging.
</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>

<p><h3>Labs</h3> Attendance at labs is <b>required</b>. A short
  programming assignment will be given at the beginning of the lab and
  the lab instructor will be available to help students with the
  programming. If not completed the lab may be taken home. Lab
  assignments will be due at the <b>beginning</b> of the following lab
  period.  <b>No</b> late lab assignments will be accepted.

<p><h3>Quizzes</h3> There will be occasional unannounced quizzes given in labs. A missed quiz cannot be made up. The lowest quiz score for the semester will be dropped.

<p><h3>Projects</h3>Projects In addition to the labs there will be several larger programming projects. These will be presented and discussed in the lecture. Late programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty. You are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed" and "my roommate ate my program" are not reasons for late submissions). If your program isn't the way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near, submit it anyway for partial credit. Blackboard permits you to retrieve and resubmit your assignment until the due date, so you may resubmit if you improve your program prior to the deadline.  <b>Any resubmissions after the deadline require approval from the TA. No resubmissions may be made after a project has been graded.</b>


<p><h3>Individual work</h3>
You are free to discuss ideas for both the labs and projects with other students, however <b>no joint work is permitted</b>. Any submitted work must be yours alone. Any work which shows too much similarity with others' submitted work will receive a grade of 0. Extreme or repeat cases may result in failing the course or referral to the Honor Commitee.
<br><br>
Read the <a
  href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS
  Department honor code</a> and the <a
  href="http://www.gmu.edu/academics/catalog/9798/honorcod.html">University honor code</a>. You are
  bound by these honor codes.

<p><h3>Grading</h3>In addition to the labs and projects there will be a midterm exam and a final. There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <I>must</I> be arranged in advanced. Grades will be computed using a weighted average of these scores with the weights:
<ul>
<li> labs: 20%
<li> quizzes: 10%
<li> projects: 30%
<li> midterm exams: 20%
<li> final exam: 20%
</ul>
In addition, to get a passing grade in the course you must obtain at
least 60% average grade on exams <I>AND</I> you have to attend all labs.
