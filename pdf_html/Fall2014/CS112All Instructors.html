<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Programming projects will be a primary focus of your grade - each one
should take multiple sessions of coding, with questions asked in
between. This is the practice you need to learn, master, and
internalize various concepts of the course.
</p>

<p>
<b>All project grades will be averaged together evenly.</b>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>projects can be turned in at most 48 hours late, no exceptions
</li>
<li>each 24-hour period entered after the deadline lowers the maximum
score by 25% (not quite the same as a 25% penalty)
</li>
<li>each student gets three One-Late-Day tokens, which are
automatically used by late submissions to avoid the 25% penalty;
you still must turn in work within 48 hours of the original
deadline, even if you use tokens!
</li>
<li>the last project might not be allowed to be turned in late, to
facilitate end-of-semester grading.
</li>
<li>unused late-tokens will be worth a small bounty at the semester's
end (0.25% of the semester grade).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2</span> Dropping an Early Project Score</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
For the first four projects, we will drop the lowest. This is to help
you get used to the nature of programming projects without destroying
your semester grade in the process. By mid-semester, you should
understand the process.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-3"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.3</span> Broken Code == Bad Scores</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
After the first two projects, any code turned in that does not run
(immediately crashes due to errors), specifically on Python 3.4, will
receive at most 50%. No exceptions. At this point, if the grader is
able to quickly fix your code, you might get some points back. If the
grader cannot immediately spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate
to get any points at all.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Turning in code that runs is a big deal!</i>

<h4 id="sec-2-1-4"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.4</span> Turning it in on BlackBoard</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-4">
<p>
You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
and only the last version will be graded. You can also download your
submitted attempts, and verify that you turned in a working copy.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero.
</li>
<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are stolen,
or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who forgot to
(frequently) back up your work!

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Lab Assessments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
All lab assessment grades will be averaged together. Lab assessments
will be weekly tasks or quizzes, to be completed during lab.  Time in
lab will often be available to seek assistance on projects when you've
completed the lab task.
</p>

<p>
Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the reason
why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major award, getting
married, saving the universe, etc.)
</p>

<p>
We will <b>drop the lowest grade</b> from this category.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to miss some early on, and later on have to miss for
some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save the drop so
you can actually throw out a bad grade, and not just to hide a lazy
zero.
</p>

<p>
The online Zyante text has animations and questions built into
it. Your completion percentage of all assigned readings (by the end of
the semester) will be used as two lab grades, which <i>cannot be
dropped</i>.

<li>these tests will focus on performing programming.
</li>
<li>they will be entirely paper and pencil - no computers.
</li>
<li>all students must have their <b>GMU identification available on
testing days</b>
</li>
<li>if you miss a test, and a valid reason is verified with
documentation (ER visit, traffic accident on the way to the test,
etc.), we may elect to allow the final exam to count the extra
amount to give you a sort of do-over. This policy is not automatic,
however.
</li>
<li>if you miss the final, there is nothing we can do for you. <b>Don't
miss the final!</b>
</li>
<li>the final will not be given early. You are starting the course with
knowledge of the schedule (see <a href="http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/fall-2014/exams/">GMU's Final Exam Calendar</a> for the
latest schedule, updated as weather events require).
</li>

<li><b>You must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b> You also need to
have a passing percentage grade, but failure on the final exam
indicates a systemic lack of true progress. Generally, students who
fail the final exam do not have a passing grade in the course
anyways.
</li>
<li>there will only be a curve if specific questions end up being too
ambiguous or otherwise obviously unfair.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
grader. For all projects, quizzes, and lab assessments, that is your
GTA who leads the lab section (never a UTA). For the tests and final
exam, that is your professor.
</p>

<p>
If you have not initiated contact within a week of receiving the grade
(on BlackBoard), it is too late. We cannot entertain a swarm of
contested grades at the eleventh hour to try to maximize
end-of-semester grades.
</p>

<p>
We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often
through specific test cases, which might even be automated as part of
the grading process. All GTAs coordinate together with a shared
scoring breakdown and regularly communicate with each other before,
during, and after the grading process to keep it fair.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The Honor Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of
your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must
ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</p>


<p>
We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply
will not be tolerated.
</p>

<p>
As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from
a friend, or even to just work on the project on your own machines
next to each other, remember that it is just as easy to compare your
work electronically, and discover the similarities in text and
structure. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and
then review them by hand to find the cases that must be submitted to
the Office of Academic Integrity.  Repeat to yourself: <b>it's not worth
trying to cheat.</b> We will catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn
it in.
</p>

<p>
The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade,
to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases of
cheating almost always translate into course failure.

<li>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented

performance should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
appropriate accommodations. We are quite happy to assist as is
appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time. Bringing the
paperwork with you to a scheduled exam is far too late! Even if you
