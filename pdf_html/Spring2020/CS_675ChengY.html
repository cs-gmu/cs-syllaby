		  <h2>Description</h2>
		  <p> Welcome to the graduate course on Distributed Systems.
		  This course introduces you to an exciting range of materials in this
		  broad and hugely important field, including the fundamentals of
		  distributed systems, massive-scale cloud storage, big data
		  foundation, serverless computing, systems support of distributed
		  machine (deep) learning, and a wide range of other important
		  techniques and case studies about this fascinating area of study.
		  </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		  <p>The only prerequisite is CS571. However, if you believe
you have some of the following background: </p>
	      <ul>
			<li>familiar with (operating/distributed/computer) systems; </li>
			<li>have taken Mason’s undergrad operating systems course (CS471) and got a B- or better;</li>
			<li>know how networks work (CS455);</li>
			<li>have had industry experience.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>You should be in communication with me (the instructor) before the semester begins to request an override.
		  </p></br>

		  <h2>Who is this course for</h2>
		  <p>This course is primarily intended for graduate students
		  (CS/ECE/IST) and motivated seniors who want to learn the latest
		  research advances in distributed systems and cloud computing areas,
		  and are interested in building distributed systems used/demanded by
		  existing/emerging data-intensive applications. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Materials</h2>
		  <p>No textbook required. The course is based on readings
		  (listed in the schedule of the course web page: 
		  <a href="https://tddg.github.io/cs675-spring20/">https://tddg.github.io/cs675-spring20/</a>) and
		  in-class discussions/presentations.</p>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Topics</h2>
		  <p>A tentative list of topics covered in this class:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Time & clocks, primary-backups</li>
			<li>Remote procedure calls, and RPCs in Go</li>
			<li>Go systems programming</li>
			<li>Distributed consensus</li>
			<li>MapReduce, Spark</li>
			<li>Serverless computing</li>
			<li>NoSQL, Memcached</li>
			<li>Datacenter resource scheduling</li>
			<li>Cluster scheduling</li>
			<li>Machine learning systems</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>
		  
		  <h2>Labs</h2>
		  <p> There will be a few programming labs to get you
		  warmed up and going this semester. They will be linked
		  from the main page and due about 1 or 2+ weeks from the day
		  they are assigned. In these lab assignments, you will learn
		  hands-on what it is to build distributed systems and cloud
		  computing applications, usually with one partner. <strong>The assignments will
		  involve extensive use of Go language and real-world cloud resources. And therefore, each student
		  is expected to receive a number of AWS (or Google) cloud
credits ($50-$200) for working on real-world cloud platforms.
</strong> You should expect two (and hopefully one optional)
	programming labs: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Lab 1: Implement a basic pluggable RPC serverless framework.</li>
			<li>Lab 2: Develop fault tolerant MapReduce atop the framework built in Lab 1.</li>
			<li>Lab 3 (optional): Build a microservice app (e.g., Hotel reservation) by expanding on Lab 1.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>
		  
		  <h2>Course project</h2>
		  <p>The most important work outside of class will be the
		  final project. This will form a large part of your grade,
		  and is also done with a parter or two.  Projects are the
		  beginning of your venture into the world of research, and
		  thus will be open-ended explorations of some kind. More
		  information on final projects will be given about 1.5
		  months from the beginning of the semester. The final
		  projects consist of a few phases with milestones: i) project proposal,
		  ii) project checkpoint report, iii) final presentation and/or demo,
		  and iv) final report and source code.</p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Grading policy</h2>
		  <p>Your grade will be calculated as follows: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>30% Labs</li>
			<li>10% Midterm exam</li>
			<li>15% Paper review forms</li>
			<li>10% Final exam</li>
			<li>35% Final project</li>
		  </ul>
		  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
		  Note: No credit if your project does not compile. Late
		  submissions of lab assignments and projects will be penalized at 15%
		  each day, and will not be accepted after 3 days of the due date. The
		  students are responsible for keeping back-ups of their work while
		  they are working on an assignment. 
		  </div>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Academic integrity</h2>
		  <p>All students must adhere to the 
		  <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">
			GMU Honor Code</a>
		  and the 
		  <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">
			Computer Science
			Department's Honor Code
		  </a>
		  Policies. The students are supposed to work individually on
		  the homeworks, assignments projects, unless told otherwise.
		  We reserve the right to use 
		  <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">
			MOSS
		  </a>
		  to detect plagiarism. Violation of the Honor
		  Code will result in an F. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Accommodations for disabilities</h2>
		  <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may
		  affect academic performance, you should: </p>
		  <ol>
			<li>make sure this documentation is
			  on file with Office for Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 4205; 993-2474;
			  <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">
				http://ods.gmu.edu</a>) to determine the accommodations you need;</li> 
			<li>talk
			  with the instructor within the first week of the semester
			  to discuss any accommodation needs.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </br>
