      <span class="section">Grading Policies</span><p/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Grades within a category (i.e. midterms, projects, labs) are
          weighted equally.
        </li>
        <li>Students must show their Mason ID card when taking exams.</li>
        <li>
          By department policy, the student <span class="alert">must pass the final <i>or</i>
          the weighted average of all three exams must be a
          passing grade (&ge; 60) in order for a student to pass the course</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final exam is cumulative; a high final exam score dominates
          (replaces) lower scores on one or both of the midterms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Challenging of any grade must occur within a week of when the 
          graded assignment has been returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any number of resubmissions are allowed (the most recent is used),
          however a resubmission turned in after the deadline will be 
          considered a late submission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lab exercise grading is fully automated.  Quizzes may be hand-graded.
          Lab task and project grading is partially automated.  Even when
          manually graded, code which does not compile will receive a zero
          in most cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Absences are absorbed by the drop policy - in general, make-ups
          are not allowed except on exams (provided a valid excuse).
        </li>
        <li>Assignments are typically due at midnight on the listed due date.</li>
        <li>
          Late work can be mitigated by <i>emergency tokens</i> (see below).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <span class="section">Emergency Tokens</span><p/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every student begins the semester with a non-replenishing allotment
          of three emergency tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          For every emergency token, a submitted assignment (programming
          projects and lab exercises) can be submitted a day (24 hours) late 
          without penalty.  An assignment can be submitted two days late at 
          the cost of two tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          No assignment will be accepted more than 2 days late (i.e. if
          3 tokens are available, at most 2 of them can be used on the
          assignment).
        </li>
        <li>
          Without applying tokens, a one day late assignment can receive
          a maximum score of 75%, while a two day late assignment can
          receive a maximum score of 50%.  Beyond that an assignment receives
          a zero, regardless of tokens.  The score is a score cap rather than a penalty (a one day late assignment which would have recieved an 85% would still get a 75%).
        </li>
        <li>
          Tokens are applied in the order that assignments are submitted, such that projects have priority over labs (tokens are first applied to projects and then to labs if there are any remainng); a student cannot pick and choose
          where to use tokens to maximize impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tokens are use-it-or-lost it; if a student has tokens remaining at
          the end of the semester, nothing happens with them.
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="alert"><i>Make backups</i>, because the unexpected happens, and cannot be
          used as an excuse to get an extension.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Submission times are automatically recorded by Blackboard, and 
          there's no distinction between a tiny bit late and nearly a day 
          late - plan ahead to make sure that your submission is on time.
        </li>
        <li>
          To receive a grade, the submission must be gradable.  This means
          submitting <code>.java</code> source rather than compiled 
          <code>.class</code> files or
          word documents containing the source.  It also means that the
          code must be submitted on Blackboard rather than simply saved.
        </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>
        
      <li><h3>Honor Code</h3><p>
      Unless specific instructions are given to the contrary, programming 
      assignments are an individual effort, no group work is allowed.  
      In addition to code, this includes the sharing of test cases, 
      pseudocode, or approaches, receiving assistance in debugging code,
      as well as the use of external Internet sites.<p>
      
      Both the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor 
      Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Department Honor Code</a> apply in this class.  Any use of a direct
      contribution on any program, homework, quiz, or exam will be
      reported as a violation of the honor code.
      <p/>

	  <li><h3>Special Accommodations</h3><p>
      Students who have a right to accommodations due to disabilities or other
      conditions should discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
      Accommodations will follow the recommendations of the University's
      <a href="https://ds.gmu.edu/">Office of Disability Services</a>.
