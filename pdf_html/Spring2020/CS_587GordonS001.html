  <h2 class="title">Course Overview</h2>
  <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
      The course will provide an introduction to modern cryptography.
      We will cover many practical topics, such as how to correctly
      use block ciphers and hash functions for the most common tasks:
      encryption and message authentication, the differences
      between public key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography,
      and a few ways to build public key encryption and signatures.
      We will learn about how to properly define security, and how to
      prove that our constructions are secure.  In addition, with what
      time we remains, we will cover several recent topics in
      cryptography, such as the use of block chains for crypto
      currencies, and securely computing on private data. </p>
      
    <p> <em><strong>Objectives</strong></em><br>
      The main objectives are to convey the importance
      of <em>provable</em> security, to teach students how to use
      cryptographic tools in a way that is provably secure, to
      provide students with the ability to decide whether a
      protocol is secure, and to demonstrate the range of what can be
      achieved with provable security.  </p>

    <p> <em><strong>Course Outcomes</strong></em><br>
	Students taking this class will: (a) be able to understand the
	security properties achieved by common cryptographic
	mechanisms such as encryption or digital signatures, (b) be
	familiar with a number of cryptographic primitives
	available to solve a variety of problems, (c) gain
	some experience with how these cryptographic tools can be used to secure
	modern systems.   
      
    <p> <em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
      There are no formal prerequisites for this course, and I intend
      for everything to be self-contained. However,
      students should have some level of mathematical
      maturity. Accordingly, a
      course such as CS330 would be a good course to take prior to
      this one.  Students should be comfortable writing proofs, and
      should have comfort with basic probability theory.   </p>

  <h2 class="title">Course Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There will be 10 homework assignments. Homework will be due
    on Thursdays.
    Students are welcome to work in groups, but <em>every student
    must write their solutions independently.</em>  Homework that
    appear overly similar will be considered to violate the honor
    code. 
    <p>I encourage students to type their answers, both because they
    will be easier to read, and also because I believe it helps you clarify your
    own thinking.  You can use
    this <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/ftqxrpjvqsjv">LaTex
    template file</a>, if it is helpful to you.  Please post on
    piazza if you have trouble. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     There will be one mid-term and one final exam. The final exam is
     scheduled by the University: Tuesday, May 12, 1:30-4:15. Each will cover
     roughly half of the semester.  The final will NOT be
     cumulative.  Both exams are closed book, and notes will NOT be
     allowed.  The exams are weighted such that the better score
     counts for more points (see below).   </p>
    </blockquote>
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     Quizzes are short: 1-2 questions, multiple choice or
     fill-in-the-blank. You will need a laptop or phone to answer the
     questions, as the results will be tallied immediately. Each
     single quiz is worth < 1% of your grade. They will be given at
     the start of class (don't be late!), on Tuesdays. They will cover
     the previous 1 or 2 lectures, and mainly 
     serve to help me gauge what the students have understood, and
     what needs further explanation.  </p>
			    </blockquote>

  <h3>CS 587</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Students in CS 587 will be be given extra homework problems on
    most homeworks, and an extra problem on each of the exams.  They
      will also have to read Chapter 7 independently.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>Grading</h3>
  <blockquote>
    	  Quizzes -- 10% <br>
	  Homeworks -- 30%.  The lowest two homework
	  grades will be dropped. <br>  
	  <!-- Programming assignment -- 20% <br> -->
	  Exams -- 60%.
	Of the two exams, the higher score will be weighted to count
	  for 35%, and the lower for 25%.  </p>
