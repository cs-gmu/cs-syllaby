	<h2>1.3 Textbook</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mark Allen Weiss, <b>Data Structures &amp; Problem Solving
			Using Java, </b>4th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2010. <a
			href="http://users.cs.fiu.edu/%7Eweiss/dsj4/errata/">Errata</a><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			It is assumed that students read the scheduled sections
			prior to each lecture.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>1.4 Software &amp; Programming Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You will need a computer for this class with some modern
			operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember
			that lab computers are also available on campus, see campus
			resources below.
		</li>
		<li>
			The prerequisite for this course is C or better in CS 211. We
			will assume that you have developed a significant degree of
			skill in programming (program organization, coding, documenting,
			testing and debugging) -- you will develop yet more this
			semester. We will also assume that you are acquainted with basic
			complexity analysis ("big O") and are able to build abstract
			data types using Java classes.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>1.5 Discussion Board: <b>Piazza</b></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Course schedule, announcements, lecture slides, assignments,
			discussion. GTA/UTA contacts and office hours will be on Piazza
			too. Sign up yourself by following this link:
			<a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/spring2020/cs310/">https://piazza.com/gmu/spring2020/cs310/</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The discussion board on Piazza is required reading for all
			projects</b>. You MUST read the discussion board for
			clarifications and project updates.
		</li>
		<li>
			All instructors and TAs can view all material on Piazza.
		</li>
		<li>
			No sharing answers or code solutions to assignments on the
			discussion board. You can include code in private posts to the
			instructors (visible to all professors, GTAs, and UTAs). See
			Honor code section below for more details.
		</li>
		<li>
			Email course staff only for logistical issues such as meeting
			outside of office hours, missing lab/lecture, grading disputes,
			medical situations, etc. Email addresses are listed on Piazza.
		</li>
		<li>
			Do not e-mail course staff about programming problems; use the
			discussion board.</i>
		</li>

	<h2>1.6 Grades and Project Submissions: Blackboard</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Grades will be posted to <a href="http://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/">Blackboard</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Projects assignments will be submitted (per published
			deadlines) via Blackboard.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>1.7 Office Hours</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Office hours are listed for all staff on Piazza under
			(Resources/Staff).
		</li>
		<li>
			Students must make significant, individual effort on all
			projects before coming to see a GTA/professor. Waiting until the
			last minute, in the expectations that the entire project will be
			explained in one office hours session, is not feasible.
		</li>
		<li>
			Office hours are often crowded - do not rely on them for last
			minute help, as we cannot guarantee that we will be able to
			spend significant time with every student. You can also use the
			discussion board for posting questions.

	<h1>2. Course Description</h1>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>2.2 Course Topics</h2>
	<p>
		CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211.
		Students will learn how to approach larger and more challenging
		programming problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a
		significant part of this course and students should expect to
		spend a good deal of time on the programming projects. The course
		also introduces a variety of data structures and illustrates the
		types of problems for which they are useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tentative topics to be covered include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lists, Stacks, and Queues</li>
		<li>Hash Tables and Hashing</li>
		<li>Trees and Basic Tree Algorithms</li>
		<li>Graphs and Basic Graph Algorithms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		See the schedule available on Piazza (under Resources) for a
		more detailed topics list.
	</p>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>2.3 Course Outcomes</h2>
	<p>
		In CS310, students will:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Gain an ability to analyze the runtime efficiency of
			algorithms that create and manipulate data structures.
		</li>
		<li>
			Gain an ability to compare data structure trade-offs
			such that the student is able to choose appropriate
			implementations for a given data structure and appropriate
			data structures for a given application.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reinforce their knowledge of basic data structures
			(linked lists, dynamic array lists, stacks, and queues)
			and extend their knowledge to more sophisticated data
			structures, including hash tables, balanced trees,
			priority queues, and basic graphs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Implement and use learned data structures to solve real
			computing problems. This includes substantial reinforcement
			of language-specific techniques for abstract data types
			and design and debugging techniques.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p> Small amounts of extra credit may be offered throughout
	the semester, but there will be no make-up or extra-credit

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>3.2 Programming Assignments</h2>
	<p>
		Students will receive a number of programming projects during the
		semester (typically four). These programming projects will be a
		primary focus of your grade - each one should take multiple sessions
		of coding, with questions asked in between. Don't be surprised if
		you're spending 20+ hours on each one. Programming projects are
		<b>INDIVIDUAL</b> work.
	</p>
	<p>
		All projects numbered <b>above 0</b> will be averaged together evenly.
		If there is a Project 0 (some professors/semesters have this), it
		will not be part of the calculation, but instead act as a "flag".
		If you do not pass Project 0 you will not receive credit for any project
		until you do (infinite resubmissions for Project 0 will be allowed).
		If at the time of the final exam you still have not passed Project 0,
		your project grades will be replaced with a 0s.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>[MARCH CLARIFICATION]</b> Project 3 and Project 4 (each three week assignments)
		will be replaced with Assignments 1-3 (each two week assignments). This
		portion of the semester grade (20%) will be divided evenly with each 
		assignment worth ~6.66% of the semester grade.
	</p>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h3>3.2.1 Submissions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All projects are to be submitted to Blackboard. You can
			submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
			and by default only the last version will be graded.
		</li>
		<li>
			Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero. You
			can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that
			you turned in a working copy.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you turn in the wrong files, the ONLY way you MIGHT receive
			credit is by showing your professor a backup where the modified
			date on the files is <b>outside of your control</b>. Modified 
			dates on personal computers and/or public computers are <i>NEVER</i>
			accepted as proof of work. Backups which WILL ALWAYS be considered
			are: prior submissions to Blackboard or emails to your Professor/GTA.
			Backups which MIGHT be accepted include: emails from your GMU email
			to yourself, uploading to certain backup services (such as
			GoogleDrive or a private GitHub repo), and uploads to the discussion
			forum.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Broken Code == Bad Scores</b>. Any code turned in that
			does not compile, specifically on Java 1.8 will receive a zero.
			If the grader is able to quickly fix your code, you might get
			<i>some</i> points back, and you'll be fortunate to get any at all.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h3>3.2.2 Deadlines</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Projects can be turned in <b>at most 24 hours</b> late, no
			exceptions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Submitting a project after the deadline lowers the maximum
			score by <b>25%</b> (not quite the same as a 25% penalty). One minute
			late is the same as 23 hours and 59 minutes late.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each student gets <b>2</b> "Emergency" tokens, which
			are automatically used by late submissions to avoid
			the 25% penalty; you still must turn in work within 24 hours
			of the original deadline, even if you use tokens!
		</li>
		<li>
			Unused emergency-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a student's
			overall grade at the semester's end.
		</li>
		<li>
			Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in
			a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
			somehow unavailable or giving an error, you MUST email your
			submission to your GTA (and CC your professor) before the
			deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.
		</li>
		<li>
			Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
			extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
			service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
			it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
			stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
			forgot to (frequently) back up your work!
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h3>3.2.3 Honor Code and Projects</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Programming projects are considered <b>individual</b>
			efforts, therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of
			problem solutions are allowed with anyone except the TAs or
			the professor. Student projects will be manually and
			automatically assessed for cheating.
		</li>
		<li>
			You may not use any Internet resources to create code or
			algorithms, besides the textbooks, the slides, and Piazza,
			unless otherwise specified. However, you are free to look up
			the syntax errors your encounter online, to gain an
			understanding of what the syntax error means. The projects
			we're doing this semester can be directly solved using
			techniques discussed in class, and no outside material is
			needed unless otherwise noted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
			a password, to not post your code to websites like Pastebin
			that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
			computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
			computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
			your code.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>3.3 Participation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			5% of semester total is based on participation activities
			determined by individual instructors.
			<br /> <b>[MARCH CLARIFICATION]</b>
			<ul>
				<li>50% will be from activities before the Midterm</li>
				<li>50% will be from activities after the Midterm</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			There MAY be up to 1% of the total semester available
			in extra credit from these activities.
			<br /> <b>[MARCH CLARIFICATION]</b>
			<ul>
				<li>50% will be from activities before the Midterm</li>
				<li>50% will be from activities after the Midterm</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
		
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>3.4.1 Exam Readings</h2>
	<p><b>[MARCH CLARIFICATION]</b> One third of the final exam grade (10% of the
	semester grade) will be earned by doing online activities in an interactive
	"zyBook" every week between the midterm and the end of the semester. Each week 
	there will be an "assigned reading" in this interactive book which earn 
	points towards the final exam. The book is free. All "assigned readings" in
	the book will be weighed together evenly when counted towards the final
	exam score.</p>

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>3.4.2 Exams</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by
			instructor. They will be entirely paper and pencil - no
			computers.
		</li>
		<li>
			All students must have their GMU identification available on
			testing days.
		</li>
		<li>
			The final exam is cumulative.
		</li>
		<li>
			Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances
			(as judged by the instructors) and must be arranged in advance. Vacation
			plans are not exceptional circumstances.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
			absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
			the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
			your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
			approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
			Failure to follow these policies will result in a zero. We may
			elect to replace a missed midterm with some (or all) of the final
			exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam under these circumstances.
		</li>
		<li>
			Missing an exam due for any non-university-accepted reason (such as 
			not paying attention to when the exam is), will result in a zero.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2>3.5 Contesting Grades</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
			grader. For projects, that is your GTA. For exams, that is your
			professor.
		</li>
		<li>
			Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested
			within one week of receiving the grade (on BlackBoard). No grade
			changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline or
			subsequent to the final exam (whichever comes first).
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h1>4. <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font> <a name="honor_code"></a> </h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All students are expected to abide by the <a
			href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
			This policy is rigorously enforced. Cheating will be prosecuted
			and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined
			in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,
			collaboration, or looking at any code or algorithm for the
			programming projects that is not your own, including resources
			from Internet, is considered cheating</font>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The computer science department has an <a
			href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
			Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our
			course. The document helps you to understand how GMU honor code
			applies to programming and CS, what constitutes cheating in the
			CS setting. It clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
			sorts of assignments. Make sure you read and familiarize
			yourself with these rules.
		</li>
		<li>
			We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
			copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
			honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
			software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
			the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
			Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
			than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. <b>Confirmed
			cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.</b>

	<h2>5.1 Disability Services</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Due to the size of the class, individual professors and graders cannot 
			support students with injuries or disabilities on an ad-hoc basis.
			We ask that all accommodations for such conditions be arranged through
			GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Students with a physical or learning disability which is <b>already
			documented with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability
			Services</a>)</b> should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
			their approved accommodations. Even if you don't know whether you plan
			on utilizing the accommodations for any assignment/test, you need to
			make sure you and your professor are working together from the beginning
			of the semester to ensure your success in the class.
		</li>
		<li>
			Students with a physical or learning disability who have <b>not yet registered
			with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a></b>
			should register with that office as soon as possible. Even if you don't
			know whether you'll need to utilize the accommodations, it's in your
			best interest to prepare ahead of time and get your condition documented
			as accommodations are not retroactive. They have a quick and easy registration
			process. All you need is documentation for your condition.

		<li>
			The <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a>
			also <b>handles services for many temporary disabilities</b> (for example,
			if you break your arm, they can arrange note taking services).
			Please contact them if you discover any sudden impairment that affects
