<P align=left><B>Overview</B> <BR>This course provides an introduction 
to the
fundamental concepts in Data Mining </P>Course Outcomes:
<UL>
  <LI>The ability to apply computing principles, probability and 
statistics
  relevant to the data mining discipline to analyze data.
  <LI>A thorough understanding of model programming with data mining 
tools,
  algorithms for estimation, prediction, and pattern discovery.
  <LI>The ability to analyze a problem, identifying and defining the 
computing
  requirements appropriate to its solution: data collection and 
preparation,
  functional requirements, selection of models and prediction 
algorithms,
  software, and performance evaluation.
  <LI>The ability to understand performance metrics used in the data 
mining
  field to interpret the results of applying an algorithm or model, to 
compare
  methods and to reach conclusions about data.
  <LI>The ability to communicate effectively to an audience the steps 
and
  results followed in solving a data mining problem (through a term 
project)
