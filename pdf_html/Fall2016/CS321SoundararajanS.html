	<h4> Description </h4>
	<p> An introduction to concepts, methods, and tools for the creation of large-scale software systems. Methods, tools, notations, and validation techniques to analyze, specify, prototype, and maintain software requirements. Introduction to object-oriented requirements modeling, including use case modeling, static modeling, and dynamic modeling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Concepts and methods for the design of large-scale software systems. Fundamental design concepts and design notations are introduced. A study of object-oriented analysis and design modeling using the UML notation. Students participate in a group project on software requirements, specification, and object-oriented software design.</p>
	
	<h4> Course Outcomes </h4>
	<p> Upon completion of this course, students should have: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>An understanding of all phases of the software engineering lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance).</li>
	<li>An understanding of several software lifecycle models including both prescriptive and agile models and knowledge of tradeoffs among these models.</li>
	<li>An ability to create and use UML models to develop and document software requirements, analysis and design artifacts.</li>
	<li>An understanding of fundamental project management and leadership issues for software teams.</li>
	<li>An ability to apply software engineering methods to accomplish the requirements and design phases of a large software project.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> CS 321 will have a software engineering project that requires student to participate in working teams where students organize, manage, and practice a software engineering project. The team project will cover software requirements, design, coding and testing. </p>
	<p> CS 321 includes Writing Intensive (WI) activities that, together with those of CS 306, meet the GMU WI Requirements in the BS CS Program (http://wac.gmu.edu). This means you will write 1750 graded words (or about 7 standard pages). You will get feedback on some writing assignments and you will be able to resubmit revisions based on the feedback. For this course, part of the writing will include an individual essay on your experiences working with your team. </p>

	<h4> Honor Code </h4>
	<p>All students are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">GMU Honor Code</a>. This policy is rigorously enforced. All class-related assignments are considered individual efforts unless explicitly expressed otherwise (in writing). Review the university honor code and present any questions regarding the policies to instructor. Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code.</p>
	
	<h4> Disability Accommodations </h4>
	<p>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented with <a href = "http://ds.gmu.edu/">GMU Office of Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance should speak with me ASAP to discuss accommodations.</p>
