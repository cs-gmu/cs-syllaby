		  <h2>Description</h2>
		  <p>This is a graduate-level course that covers advanced concepts
and design principles of modern operating systems (OSes), both from theory
and practical aspects, spanning the following aspects: <strong>virtualization,
concurrency, persistence, distributed systems, and virtual machines/containers</strong>. 
The purpose of this course is to teach OS designs from a research point of view. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Course website</h2>
		  The materials are published on course webpage: <a
		  href="https://tddg.github.io/cs571-spring22/">https://tddg.github.io/cs571-spring22/</a>.</p>
		  <br/>

		  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		  <p>Grade of C or better in CS310 and CS 367 and CS 465. All
		  students *MUST* be comfortable with programming in the C language.
		  This is a strong requirement. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Topics</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>CPU virtualization (basic scheduling, advanced scheduling: CFS/ghOSt, etc.)</li>
			<li>Memory virtualization (basic memory management, caching policies: LRU/ARC)</li>
			<li>Concurrency (synchronization, concurrency control, transactions)</li>
			<li>Persistence and storage (file systems, large-scale distributed storage)</li>
			<li>Distributed systems (MapReduce/GFS, Spark)</li>
			<li>Virtual machines and containers (Xen, Firecracker, etc.)</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>

		  <!--h2>Course materials</h2>
		  <p>All course materials, including lecture notes, are
		  available through the course homepage at <a
		  href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs471_fall17.html">https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs471_fall17.html</a>.</p>
		  </br-->

		  <h2>Readings</h2>
		  <p>There are no official textbooks. Required readings are
(most frequently) in the form of seminal research papers and/or selected
textbook chapters of the awesome OSTEP textbook. 

		  <p>If you need a textbook to review and catch background,
go get <strong>OSTEP</strong>, which is an excellent resource for
learning OS and is completely free. OSTEP and is <strong>publicly available</strong> at: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)</a>, 
                by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Aug, 2018 (v 1.00)</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers
with other students in the class — you may have insights that others
do not, and vice versa. Oftentimes, students form reading groups,
which I encourage; on the other hand, I would like to point
out that group discussion is <strong>not an effective substitute for actually
reading the paper</strong>. 
		  </br>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Class participation</h2>
		  <p>In addition to textbook concepts that I will cover in
the form of lectures, for research papers, we will use a
discuss-oriented format.  Therefore, class participation is required.
We will discuss the papers and articles that we will have all read
before each class. I will provide you with a review form that you
must complete and submit before the class. I will provide feedback to
your paper reviews the night before the class.  During the class, I
will lead discussions by asking questions of students at random in
class. Note that your performance in class form 10% of your overall
grade, so it does matter that you both show up to class and
participate in the discussion (which in fact requires you to read the
papers). 
		  </br>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Labs and research project (tentative -- will be finalized as semester begins)</h2>
		  <p>There will be several programming labs and a research
project. You need to be comfortable with programming in C to complete
these lab assignments. Programming labs will be individual. For research
projects, you may choose to do it individually or in a group of two.
I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking, but I
highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas, which typically lead
to better results.  You will write a project report and present it at
the end of the course. Details concerning the projects will be
presented in class. 

		  <p>All students should have accounts on the <a
		  href="zeus.vse.gmu.edu">VSE Unix cluster</a> (aka zeus.vse.gmu.edu).
		  Instructions and related links can be found <a
		  href="http://labs.ite.gmu.edu/index.php/FAQ/ClusterAccount">here</a>.
		  Your labs written in C will be tested and graded on the zeus server. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Grading policy (tentative -- will be finalized as semester begins)</h2>
		  <p>There is no homework, no midterm, no final exams.
Discussion and paper reading carries 30%, projects carries the rest
70%. Your grade will be calcuated as follows: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>15% class participation</li>
			<li>15% paper reviews</li>
			<li>10% project proposal</li>
			<li>10% project checkpoint 1 report</li>
			<li>10% project checkpoint 2 report</li>
			<li>40% final project report, presentation and artifact eval</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The final grade is computed according to the following rules: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A+: >= 97%; A: [92%, 97%); A-: [87%, 92%)</li>
            <li>B+: [82%, 87%); B: [77%, 82%); B-: [72%, 77%)</li>
            <li>C+: [66%, 72%); C: [63%, 66%); C-: [60%, 63%)</li>
            <li>D+: [56%, 60%); D:[53%, 56%); D-: [50%, 53%)</li>
            <li>F: < 50% </li>
          </ul>
		  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
			Note: No credit if your project does not compile. Late
			submissions of programming labs and projects (proposal report, checkpoint report, 
			final report, and corresponding software artifacts)
			will be penalized at 15% each day, and will not be
			accepted after 3 days of the due date. The students are
			responsible for keeping backups of their work while
			they are working on an assignment. 
		  </div>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Academic integrity</h2>
		  <p>All students must adhere to the 
		  <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">
			GMU Honor Code</a>
		  and the 
		  <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">
			Computer Science
			Department's Honor Code
		  </a>
		  Policies. The students are supposed to work individually on
		  the homeworks, assignments projects, unless told otherwise.
		  We reserve the right to use 
		  <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">
			MOSS
		  </a>
		  to detect plagiarism. Violation of the Honor
		  Code will result in an F. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Accommodations for disabilities</h2>
		  <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may
		  affect academic performance, you should: </p>
		  <ol>
			<li>make sure this documentation is
			  on file with Office for Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 4205; 993-2474;
			  <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">
				http://ods.gmu.edu</a>) to determine the accommodations you need;</li> 
			<li>talk
			  with the instructor within the first week of the semester
			  to discuss any accommodation needs.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </br>
