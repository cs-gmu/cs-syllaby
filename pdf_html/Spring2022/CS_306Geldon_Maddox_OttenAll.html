    <p><b> Req'd Textbook: </b><i>Ethics and Law for the Computing
        Professional: Understanding the Legal Process and How Law and Ethics
        Impact Issues in Technology</i> (Geldon &amp; Maddox), Cognella, 2022.
      To order, go to: gmu.bncollege.com </p>
    <p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students
      become effective professionals in the field of computer science by
      examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding
      computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing
      with those challenges. Students will examine the philosophical bases for
      ethical decision-making and how to apply them to issues raised by
      computers and technology. Specific topics covered in CS 105/110, such as
      intellectual property concerns, will be addressed by this course in a more
      intensive manner. Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the
      computer profession and e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is
        a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much of
        our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
        dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
        chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
        apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
        opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
        may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
        and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that you
        will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU
          are the most important component of this class, so please come
          prepared to think, discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At
          the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you
          disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>
    <p align="justify"><b>Course Outcomes:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in
        computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.</li>
      <li>Be able to connect issues of computer technology to wider community
        and societal concerns using perspectives of law, ethics and computer
        science.</li>
      <li>Be able to communicate effectively in oral form.</li>
      <li>Be able to communicate effectively in written form.</li>
      <li>Be able to work with a partner and/or group to satisfy a complex task.</li>
      <li>Be able to apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the quality,
        credibility and limitations of an argument or a solution using
        appropriate evidence or resources.</li>

        Requirements:&nbsp; Spring, 2022 CS 306 classes are being offered
        in-person except for DL2, which will be offered synchronously over Zoom.
        Unless covid-19 requires a move to remote learning, all other sections
        will meet solely in person.&nbsp; However, there will be certain
        asynchronous requirements and many materials and assignments will
        require BB access to complete. </b>All students will need to be
      prepared for the following technology requirements to successfully
      complete this class:
      <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
        <ul>
          <li>a device that can access Blackboard class materials</li>
          <li>the use of a working microphone and webcam to complete certain
            projects and BB posts (and for DL2, to attend class and participate
            in class activities)</li>
          <li>for DL2 students, Internet access sufficient to attend synchronous
            class virtually through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra and/or Zoom</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a Writing Intensive (WI)
      Course that, together with CS 321, meets the GMU WI Requirements for the
      BS CS and BS ACS programs. Accordingly, each student in CS 306 is required
      to write a minimum of 1750 individual words, which will be graded and
      returned to the student with feedback. This requirement will be
      fulfilled&nbsp;by a series of short essays analyzing legal and ethical
      issues, most of which may be revised and resubmitted for an improved grade
      after receiving feedback. <b>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Each</span>
        of the first three essays&nbsp;must meet minimum wordcount requirements
        <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> earn a final grade of C or
        better in order to receive a C or better in the course.</b> Students
      will also be writing in-class essays for exams. &nbsp;In addition,
      students will work with partners to research and write materials in
      preparation for their&nbsp;Mock Trials.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Grading Policy:</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Class Participation (incl. short assignments and
      discussion boards) (15%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Short quizzes on assigned reading and recent lecture
      material (20%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Essay "Quest"&nbsp; on specific cases or course
      topics (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Essays&nbsp;on topics of law/ethics (15%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;Mock Trial Group Project and
      Presentation&nbsp;(25% total)<small><br>
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Final Exam (20%) <br>
        </big></small></p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work: &nbsp;You are expected to submit
      all work by the due date. &nbsp;</span>Late work may be accepted at the
    discretion of the instructor, but &nbsp;will be subject to a late penalty,
    typically 5-10% per day (incl. weekends).<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;The group project is divided into five parts, and no late
      work&nbsp;will be accepted after the due date for the next sequential
      part. &nbsp;NO late work of any kind will be accepted for credit after
      Saturday, May 7, 2022. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Attendance:</span>&nbsp; You should assume ALL normally scheduled classes
    are synchronous and require attendance unless specifically told
    otherwise.&nbsp; Certain class sessions will be asynchronous (not requiring
    class attendance), but these will be clearly announced in advance.&nbsp;
    Students should plan to attend ALL synchronous classes (either in person or
    by logging in through Zoom), prepared to participate and ready to discuss
    the readings and/or recorded lecture assignments for that day.&nbsp; Failure
    to do so will be reflected in your class participation grade.&nbsp;
    (Students unable to attend class due to emergency or covid-19 quarantine
    should contact their instructor immediately to make special arrangements for
    any missed classes.)&nbsp; Group project grading may include a confidential
    review of participating group members by each student, and individual grades
    may be adjusted later in the semester if deemed appropriate based on
    repeated lack of participation as evidenced by either instructor observation
    or report by fellow group members. <b>If an assignment requires inclusion
