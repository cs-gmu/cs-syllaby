<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Goals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211. Students
will learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming
problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a significant part
of this course and students should expect to spend a good deal of time
on the programming projects.  The course also introduces a variety of
data structures and illustrates the types of problems for which they
are useful.
</p>
<p>
Topics to be covered include.
</p><ul>
<li>Generics and Collections
</li>
<li>Basic Complexity Analysis
</li>
<li>Linked Lists
</li>
<li>Stacks and Queues
</li>
<li>Simple and Balanced Binary Search Trees
</li>
<li>B-Trees and File Organization
</li>
<li>Hash Tables
</li>
<li>Priority Queues

<li>Splay Trees

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Learning Outcomes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>By the end of the semester, a passing student will be able to carry
out the following types of activities:
</p><ul>
<li>Reinforce what they have learned about elementary data structures
  from CS 211
</li>
<li>Extend their knowledge of data structures to more sophisticated data
  structures. This includes balanced binary search trees, B-trees and
  B+-trees, hashing, and basic graphs.
</li>
<li>Use generic types in their data structures.
</li>
<li>Do more demanding programming than they had in CS 211. All
  programming is done in Java. This involves more program design and
  debugging techniques.

<b>It is at the sole discretion of the instructor whether to accept late homework assignments.</b> Health or family emergencies are usually legitimate
reasons for lateness but forgetfulness and procrastination are not.
Notify the instructor via e-mail (preferred) or phone if you know you
will miss a HW.  In the case of an emergency, notify the instructor as
soon as possible.  Reductions in credit may be given in any case for
late homework at the discretion of the instructor.  Typically this
will be on the order of <b>10% reduction in credit per day late</b>.

submission.  Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions.</b>
</p>
<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
<b>PRIME DIRECTIVE.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  More specific guidelines are given below.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Thou Shalt Not</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">

<p>For the purposes of this course, the following actions constitute
scholastic misconduct (cheating):
</p><ul>
<li>Directly copying someone else's solution to a homework problem,
  including student solutions from a previous semester
</li>
<li>Directly copying an answer from some outside source such as the
  Internet or friend for a homework problem
</li>
<li>Making use of an Instructor Solution manual to complete homework
  problems
</li>
<li>Paying someone for a homework solution
</li>
<li>Posting solutions to our discussion board or any other web site
</li>
<li>Collaborating or copying someone else's answer during an exam

<li>Aiding or abetting any of the above

<li>Witnessing any of the above and failing to report it the instructor

<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Penalties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">

<p>Any instance of misconduct that is detected will be referred to the
honor board and will likely result in failing the course.  Be advised
that the teaching team will be employing <b>electronic means to detect plagiarism</b>.  This is extremely easy with computer code so keep your
nose clean.

<h3 id="sec-5-3"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Fair Collaboration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">

<p>The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Talking to other students in the course about HW problems and
  informally describing how a problem may be solved.
<ul>
<li>Be <b>very careful</b> as you do this that you do not share any sort of
    code as this will be detected and referred to the honor committee.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Getting or giving help fixing a small bug or two: a second set
  of eyes is a great boon to finding that misplaced semicolon that is
  preventing your code from compiling.
</li>
<li>Searching the Internet for alternative presentations of a
  programming concept.  
</li>
<li>When unsure whether collaboration is fair or not, stop the activity
  until it can be cleared with instructor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>At all times keep the <b>PRIME DIRECTIVE</b> in mind when studying with
another student.  The above collaborations should be limited to
getting someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish
line.
</p>
<p>
A significant portion of your grade will depend on programming
assignments.  Doing them individually prepares you for the exams in which
no collaboration of any kind is allowed.

<h3 id="sec-6-1"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Programming Assignments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">

<p>Since this is a programming course, some special policies will be in
effect.
</p><ul>
<li>Programming assignments will be submitted to Blackboard at the
  specified dates.  You may submit assignments to Blackboard as many
  times as you like: only the most recent submission will be graded
  (up to the deadline). 
</li>
<li>Back up your program regularly.  This is usually as simple as
  making a copy of the assignment folder. Submitting occasional early
  versions to Blackboard is also extremely helpful.  Should
  last-minute problems happen such as accidental deletion, you will at
  least have some of your work to show.  No code to submit means no
  credit.
</li>
<li>Submitted code that does not compile will receive little to no
  credit. 
</li>
<li>When test cases are provided by the instructor use them and make
  sure your code passes all tests.
</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how plagiarism works with programming as
  described in other parts of the syllabus.
</li>
<li>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission. It is
  important that you not touch your programs once you have made your
  final submission. If there are any submission problems,
  consideration for credit will only be given if it can be verified
  that the programs were not changed after being submitted.
</li>
<li>You may develop programs using any computer system available.
  However, submitted assignments must run under the Java environment
  available on either Zeus or Mason.  No extensions will be given due

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Guidelines for Success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">

<ul>
<li>Most homework problems have analogs that are (1) discussed in
  lecture or (2) described in an example problem in the textbook.
  This should encourage you to
<ul>
<li>Attend lecture and take notes
</li>
<li>Read the content of each section of the textbook carefully
</li>
<li>Analyze the example code distributed by the instructor
</li>
</ul>

<p>  Most successful students do all of these.
</p></li>
<li>Seek help from the instructor or teaching assistant when a
  concept is unclear.  If you blow a problem on a HW or exam and don't
  see why, attend office hours to ask about it.  We are here to aid
  your learning process.
</li>
<li>Form good habits early on.  We have a large amount of material to
  cover which means you will need to spend time outside of lecture
  reading and experimenting. Things will move <b>fast</b> so don't fall
  behind.
</li>
<li>There is a wealth of information on data structures online.  Don't
  be afraid to consult online tutorials if a particular topic is
  troublesome for you.  However, <b>do not</b> misuse to the Internet to
  obtain solutions that you don't understand.  Follow the <b>PRIME   DIRECTIVE</b> at all times.
</li>
</ul>
