<h1>ISA 763 Security Protocol Verification - Fall 2013</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>


<p>Teaches how to design, understand, verify, and test communication protocols so they meet their objectives of recognizing the basic components of a communication protocol. These include specifying security properties accurately,  modeling actors and malefactors against which a protocol ought to be secure and discussing verification and testing methods, including  their limitations.  This is a graduate level class where we read many papers and apply their methods to model and verify the properties of protocol that are being used today.</p>



<h2>Time permitting, this year's class will focus on the following topics</h2>

<ul>

<li> Specifying components of protocols using CSP (Casper and FDR) and Pi (Spi and Applied Pi) calculus 

<li> Composing Security properties using Protocol Composition Logic

<li> Formal basis for Trusted Computing:Protocols and Correctness arguments.

<li> Comparison between formal and computational models of cryptographic protocols

</ul>


<h2>Textbook</h2>

<ul>

<li>Title: The modeling and analysis of security protocols: The CSP Approach

<li>Authors: P.Y.A. Ryan, S.A. Schneider, M.H. Goldsmith, G. Lowe and A.W. Roscoe

<li>Available at <a href= "http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/personal/st/S.Schneider/books/MASP.pdf">CSP Text</a>

<li>Many other (parts of) textbooks and papers will be assigned as reading as the class progresses.

<li> All relevant material, including papers and powerpoint presentations and other material will be distributed

<li> Follow the GMU blackboard page for the class closely
