      <p><strong>Course Description:</strong>      </p>
      <blockquote> 
     CS 367 provides students with an introduction
     to computer sysems from a programmer's perspective.  
     Topics include machine-level representation of data and programs, 
     linking and loading, processes, virtual memory and dynamic memory 
     allocation.

       Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
     <p>
       <ul>
  <li>Design and implement C programs that use structs and dynamic memory allocation.</li>
  <li>Use debuggers.</li>

      <h4>Texts:      </h4>
               
      <blockquote>
     The required textbook for this class is <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu"<i>Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</i></a> by Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron, Second Edition 2010.  (The book's website has links to other helpful material on C and Linux.)

      <p>
      A well-known reference for the C programming language is Kernighan &amp
      Ritchie's book <i>C Programming Language</i>, Second edition,
      Prentice Hall, 1988. (This is a useful resource if you need a C refersher.)
      
      <p></blockquote>

      <hr width="90%" />

      <h4>Course Requirements &amp; Grading:      </h4>

      <blockquote>The course grade is based on lab projects, homework
      assignments,  quizzes & class participation, two midterm exams, and
      a comprehensive final exam:

        <blockquote> Lab projects &amp Homework: &nbsp;&nbsp;45%<br />
         Quizzes &amp class participation: &nbsp;&nbsp;10%<br />
         Two Midterm Exams: &nbsp;&nbsp;20 % <br />
         Comprehensive Final Exam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 % <br />
        </blockquote>

       <p> There will be two homework assignments and at least four lab projects.
      The relative weight for each assignment is based on the amount of
      effort that is required. 
      See the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pwang/cs367/timetable.html">Lecture Timetable</a> for important dates.  The dates of quizzes will not be announced.
       <p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>

        <b>All required coursework must be completed by the stated due date 
         and time.  Late coursework will not be accepted and make-up tests
        will not be given for missed examinations. </b>

      </blockquote>
      <hr width="90%" />

      <h4>Honor Code: </h4>

      <blockquote> 
      Most of the homework and lab projects must be done individually. However, a few assignments permit students to work in groups of up to two students.
       All required coursework for this class (assignments, tests, etc) must 
        adhere to Mason's and the CS Department's Academic
        Integrity and Honor Code Policies described here:<br /> 
       <blockquote><a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage</a>.</blockquote>     

      Please note that collaboration between students in different groups
      within and outside of this course section is not acceptable. Further,
     <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS</a> will be used to detect plagiarism in the lab
      assignments.
      </blockquote>

      <hr width="90%" />

      <h4>Computer Accounts:      </h4>
      <blockquote>
       Projects for this class are graded using Zeus, a VS&ampE Linux-based system, so you need to have 
       an account on this system. See <a href="http://labs.ite.gmu.edu"> http://labs.ite.gmu.edu</a> for 
       information.  
       Even if you use your own computer, you will probably need to run your codes on the VS&ampE system
       because they will be graded there.

      <h4>Disabilities:      </h4>
      <blockquote> If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 
        (1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Office of Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 2500; 993-2474; <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu/">http://ods.gmu.edu/</a>) to determine the accommodations you need; and 
        (2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.      </blockquote>
