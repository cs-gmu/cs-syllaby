<br /><br /><font size="+1"><b>Course Scope</b></font>.
In this course, a thorough examination of several well-known techniques 
that are used for the design and analysis of algorithms will be covered. 
Topics to be covered include theoretical measures of algorithm complexity,
sorting and selection algorithms, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer
techniques, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, search strategies, 
and an introduction to the theory of NP-completeness. Additional topics
may be covered if time permits. Students are expected to have taken prior 
undergraduate courses in data structures, as well as 
calculus and discrete mathematics.

<br /><br /><font size="+1"><b>Prerequisites</b></font>.
CS 310 and CS 330 Calculus (MATH 113, 114, 213) and MATH 125

<br /><br /><font size="+1"><b>Required Textbook</b></font>.

<P>
All required assignments must be completed by the stated due date and time. 
There will be absolutely no extensions for the homework (not even in the case of emergency). 
Your lowest homework grade will not be counted towards your final grade.

<P>
Please note that all coursework is to be done independently. 
Plagiarizing the homework will be penalized by maximum
negative credit and cheating on the exam will earn you an F in the course. 
See the GMU Honor Code System and Policies at 
http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html and http://www.cs.gmu.edu/honor-code.html.
You are encouraged  to discuss the material BEFORE you do the assignment. 
As a part of the interaction  you can
discuss a meaning of the question or possible ways of approaching the solution. 
The homework should be written strictly
by yourself. In case your solution is based on the important idea of someone else 
please acknowledge that in your solution, to avoid any accusations.

<P>
You will be allowed to have one page (letter size) of notes for the midterm and two pages (one sheet)
for the final. No copying of anything from the textbook or another person is allowed. You can
write some things  verbatim. You can also write your notes on the computer and print them.
The notes sheet will be handed in with the exam. 

<P>
The quiz will be a closed book exam - no notes will be allowed.
You can also have up to two opportunities of making up your missed/failed quizzes by turning in
two CS culture assignments. A CS culture assignment is a one-page written summary 
of a talk
(please use this <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~jmlien/teaching/08_spring_cs483/CS_culture_assignment.pdf">form</a> to complete your assignment) 
from a CS seminar (see http://cs.gmu.edu/events/) that you attend during the Spring'08 semester.
