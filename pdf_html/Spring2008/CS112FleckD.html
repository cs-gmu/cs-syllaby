Objective and Information</span><a href="#top">(top)</a><br><br><br>This
course introduces the use of computer programming as a problem-solving
tool. Topics in procedural programming include expressions, control
structures, simple data types, input/output, graphical interfaces,
testing, debugging, and programming environments. During this class we
will use the Python programming language.<br><br>Students are
responsible for reading and understanding the assigned material in the
textbook, which may or may not be covered in class. Questions should be
presented in class or during instructor/GTAs office hours.<br><br>Throughout
this course we will use Blackboard (<a href="http://courses.gmu.edu">http://courses.gmu.edu</a>) for&nbsp;assignment
submissions,&nbsp;grade distributions, and discussion forums. The first
place to ask for help is through the Blackboard forums. <br><br>NOTE: All students will use section 001 in Blackboard. This is a current limitation of the Blackboard pilot program.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisite</span>:
Satisfaction of prerequisites for MATH 113. MATH 113 prerequisites:
thorough understanding of high school algebra and trigonometry, and
specified score on Math Placement Test; or grade of C or better in MATH
105. (Essentially if you have taken or are currently in MATH 113 you're
okay. If you have passed MATH 105 you're okay. If you placed out of
MATH 105 or a higher clas you're okay.)<br>&nbsp;<br><br><hr style="height: 2px; width: 70%;">

APPEAL POLICY:<br>If you feel you deserve a better grade on
an assignment, you can appeal your grade in writing. Written grade
appeals will only be accepted within 7 days of you receivng the grade.
The appeal should clearly explain why you feel you deserve a higher
grade. I will never lower your grade due to an appeal, but I may or may
not raise your grade depending on your justification.<br><br>LATE
POLICY: All assignments must be submitted by the deadline to be
considered for full credit. Late lab assignments will not be accepted.
Late projects will be tolerated, but are subject to a penalty of 20%
per day. No assignment will be accepted for credit after the last class
meeting. You should start early on all assignments. Many problems arise
when programming, both in your control and outside your control
(hardware problems, computer lab unavailable, etc...).<br><br>HONOR
CODE STATEMENT:<br>As
with all GMU courses, this course is governed by the GMU Honor Code. In
this course, all assignments, exams, and project submissions carry with
them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the author,
unless joint work is explicitly authorized. Help may be obtained from
the instructor or other students to understand the description of the
problem and any technology, but the solution, particularly the design
portion, must be the student's own work. If joint work is authorized,
all contributing students must be listed on the submission. Any
deviation from this is considered an Honor Code violation, and as a
minimum, will result in failure of the submission and as a maximum,
failure of the class.<br><br>PLAGIARISM: <br>Plagiarism
is stealing the work of others and presenting it as your
own.&nbsp;This
includes written papers, but also computer programs, presentations,
etc... anything that was not created by you should be referenced. When
in doubt, add a reference. If you have any questions about whether you
can or cannot use something you've found ask your professor or TA. If
another student let you copy their work you are BOTH guilty. Any
plagiarism violations will be sent to the Honor Committee. If you are
found guilty of plagiarism twice in your university career you will be
expelled. This is a very serious offense! More information about
plagiarism is on the <a href="http://www.writingcenter.gmu.edu/resources/handouts/plagiarism.pdf">writing
center website</a> and at <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org">plagiarism.org</a>.
If you feel the need to do this for any reason, come talk to your
professor and we'll work out a better plan. There is ALWAYS a better
plan than plagiarising!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">This class will&nbsp;use
automated tools to detect plagiarism (including written materials and
source code).</span><br><br>DISABILITY STATEMENT:<br>If
you are a student with a disability and
you need&nbsp;academic accommodations, please see me and contact
the
Disability Resource Center (DRC) at 703.993.2474. All academic
accommodations must be arranged through that office.<br><br>
