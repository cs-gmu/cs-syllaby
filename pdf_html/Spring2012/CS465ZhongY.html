	<li>Performance measurements </li>
	<li>Instructions and their representation </li>
	<li>Implementation of arithmetic operations </li>
	<li>Processor organization </li>
	<li>Pipelining </li>
	<li>The memory hierarchy</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="3">Course Outcomes
</font></b>
<br>
As an outcome of taking this class, a student will 
<ul>
<li>Be able to explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional components
<li>Be able to compare performance of simple system configurations and understand the performance implications of architectural choices
<li>Be able to understand major ISA components, including instruction types and formats, addressing modes, and data representation
<li>Be able to explain how an instruction is executed and the concept of datapaths and control
<li>Be able to explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur
<li>Be able to explain the effect of memory latency on running time; be able to describe the use of memory hierarchy to reduce the effective memory latency, in particular, the role of cache and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management
<li>Be able to explain the basic I/O implementation and data transfers
</ul>
 
<p><b>Grading Policies</b><br>

<ul>  
<li>There will be written homeworks, an in-class midterm exam, a final exam
and in-class exercises. End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows (tentative 
plan): 
  
<ul>
    <li>45% Exercises
    <ul>
        <li>40% written assignments
        <li>5% in-class exercises and/or quizzes
    </ul>
    <li>55% Exams 
      <UL>  
      <LI>25% midterm                 
      <LI>30% final 
    </UL>
    </ul>

<li>Both final and midterm exams are closed-book 
  and closed-notes. Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the 
exam.&nbsp; You must have a written excuse (doctor's note, for example) to 
miss an exam.&nbsp; No early exams will be given and make-up exams are 
strongly discouraged. 
  
<li>Letter grades will be assigned by subjectively identifying brackets in 
the numeric scores.  In order to obtain an A, your final score should be 
<i>at least</i> 90. A total score of 49 or less will result in an F.

<li>IN (Incomplete) policy as indicated in the catalog will be strictly 
adhered to. You must provide the necessary back-up documentation 
(e.g. medical certificate) for your application to be considered favorably. 
In all circumstances, the written request, with all the back up documentation, 
must be received before the final exam week.
  
<li><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy: </b>
late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day within 3 days after 
deadlines and will not be accepted three days after due.

</ul>  
  <p> <b> <font color="#D50000">Honor Code</font></b><br>
  You are expected to abide by the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Please refer to 
  <A HREF="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">
GMU Academic Policies</A> and 
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
Computer Science Department Honor Code</a>.&nbsp; <b>Any violation of the honor code will result in a zero of the 
	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class. </b>

<p><b>Disability</b><br>
If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may 
affect academic performance you should: 
<ul>
<li>check with
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc/">Office of Disability Services</a> 
to determine the accommodations you need; and
<li>talk with me regarding your needs ASAP.
</ul>
