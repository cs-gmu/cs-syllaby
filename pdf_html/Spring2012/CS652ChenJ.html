<h3><a name=DESC id="DESC"></a>DESCRIPTION:</h3>

<ul>

  <li>CS 652 is a 3-credit course with prerequisite CS 583. It gives an introduction 

    to graphics principles, advanced graphics methods, OpenGL graphics library, 

    and programming. The programming platform is Java or C. The course is taught 

    in Java.</li>

  <li>I am assuming you know the prerequisite material, Java or C programming, 

    vector analysis, and matrix calculations. After this class, you will be able 

    to do graphics modeling and animation of certain objects or behaviors of your 

    preference.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=OUTCOME id="OUTCOME"></a>COURSE OUTCOMES:</h3>

<ul>

  <li> Apply trigonometry, geometry, vector analysis, and linear algebra to solve 

    real world problems. </li>

  <li>Analyze object positions and movements to define the computing methods and 

    solutions for multiple objects.</li>

  <li> Collaborate with classmates in teams in achieving the course project. </li>

  <li>Understand and use the current techniques, skills, and tools in GPU programming 

    for advanced lighting calculations.</li>

  <li> Understand advanced graphics capabilities such as texture mapping, ray-tracing, 

    pixel shading, bumped mapping, etc.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=GRADING id="GRADING"></a>GRADING POLICY:</h3>

<blockquote> 

  <p>There are all together 100 points:</p>

  <ul>

    <li> Homework assignments announced in class and due before next class (20 

      points)</li>

    <li> In-class quizzes (20 points)</li>

    <li> One programming project (20 points)</li>

    <li> A Final Exam (40 points)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Your overall course score, S, will be the sum of these points.</p>

  <ul>

    <li> A: S is at least 90 points</li>

    <li> B: S is at least 75 points</li>

    <li> C: S is at least 55 points</li>

    <li> F: S is less than 55 points</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Each assignment/project late may not be accepted. Therefore, you should plan 

    on working early. If there is an accident or emergency and you let me know, 

    I will consider it accordingly.</p>

<h3><a name=HONORCODE id="HONORCODE"></a>HONOR CODE:</h3>

<blockquote> 

  <p><a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">GMU Honor Code</a> 

    will be enforced. You are supposed to do your own programmings, assignments, 

    and projects. Violations of GMU Honor Code will result in an F. You may form 

    into study groups, most of size 3. You can meet with your study group and 

    discuss all homework questions and projects freely and frequently in your 

    group. However, you must do your own programmings, assignments, and projects.</p>

  <p>Disability Statement: If you have a learning or physical difference that 

    may affect your academic work, you will need to furnish appropriate documentation 

    to GMU Disability Resource Center. If you qualify for accommodation, the DRC 

    staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations for your instructor. 

    If you have such a condition, you must talk to the instructor during the first 

    week of the term about the issue.</p>
