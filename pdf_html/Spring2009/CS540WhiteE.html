This course will cover the theoretical and implementation aspects of language
processing. Emphasis will be on the design and construction of compilers.
There are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this course.

<H2> Grading Policies</H2>
<UL>
<LI> There will be 4 programming assignments, together worth 50% of your grade.
These are to be <B>individual</B> efforts, meaning no sharing of code or
discussion of problem solution allowed with anyone but me or the TA.

<LI>
Midterm exam, worth 25% of your grade 
<LI>
The final exam, worth 25% of your grade, will be commulative with the primary
emphasis (70-90%) on the material not tested in the midterm.</LI>
Both the final and midterm are closed book. 
You must have a written
excuse (doctor's note, for example) to miss an exam. I reserve the right
to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written.</LI>
<LI>
It has been my experience that time is the biggest determiner of your final
grade in this class. I suggest that you start assignments when I hand them
out. They often take more time than you think.</LI>

This course is delivered to the Internet section online by Network EducationWare (NEW). Students in all sections have accounts on NEW and can play back the lectures and download the PDF slide files at <a href="http://disted.ite.gmu.edu">http://disted.ite.gmu.edu</a>.

<H2> Honor Code</H2>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts. Information on the university honor code
can be found at:

<P>
This semester I will probably be using similarity detection software to 
assist me in finding honor code violations, should they occur.
