  Two books are <strong>recommended</strong> for HTML and Java.
  Many students will already have good references for HTML and Java,
  so these are only recommended if you need them.
  Please note that I did <strong>not</strong> order these books
  through the bookstore,
 <li>HTML 4 for the World Wide Web, 4th ed., Castro, Peachpit Press.
     <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201354934/o/qid=959968323/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/103-1024002-6242217">Amazon</a>

<dt><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: <!-- From the catalog -->
<dd>
<div align="justify"><!-- Use DIV because <p> puts in extra lines -->

  Detailed study of the engineering methods and technologies
  for building highly interactive web sites
  for e-commerce and other web-based applications.
  Engineering principles for building web sites that exhibit high
  reliability, usability, security,
  availability, scalability and maintainability
  are presented.
  Methods such as
  client-server programming,
  component-based software development,
  middleware,
  and reusable components are covered.
  After the course,
  students should be prepared to create software for large-scale web sites.
</div>

<p>

<dt><b>CONTENT</b>:
<dd>
<div align="justify">
  SWE 642 teaches
  some of the topics related to the
  exciting new software development models that are used to support
  web and e-commerce applications.
  We will be studying the software design and development side
  of web applications,
  rather than the policy, business, or networking sides.
  An introductory level knowledge of HTML and Java is required.
  SWE 619 is a required prerequisite
  and SWE 632 is a good background courses.
  The class will be very practical (how to build things)
  and require extensive small programming assignments.
</div>

<p>
 The course content will focus on
 client-side
 and
 server-side software design and devlopment.
 We will learn technologies such as
 <strong>HTML</strong>,

<a href="javascript:newWindow('js-example.html')"
               onMouseOver="javascript:newWindow('js-example.html')"
               onMouseOut="javascript:killWindow()">JavaScripts</a>
 <strong>the J2EE platform</strong>,
 <strong>JDBC</strong>,
 and <strong>XML</strong>.


<p>
<dt><b>READING</b>:
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   We will read from Kurniawan, various sources on the web,
   and transparencies that will be made available on the web site.
   The schedule for the readings is given on the
   <a href="./sched.html">schedule</a> web page.

</div>

<!-- NOT NEEDED WITH QUIZZES
<p>
<dt><b>EXAMS</b>:
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   There will be a midterm and a final exam, both in class.
</div>
-->

<p>
<dt><b>MAKEUPS</b>:

<dd>
<div align="justify">
   Unless arrangements are worked out in advance,
   missed quizzes and tests <b>cannot</b> be made up,
   and 10 percent per class meeting will be deducted for late submissions.
   <!--
   Under no circumstances will any assignment be accepted after
   the official end of classes (the start of finals week).
   -->
</div>

<p>
<dt><b>HOMEWORKS</b>:
<dd>
<div align="justify">
   A number of homework assignments will be given.
   I will discuss each in class and make the assignment available
   on the class web site.
   You will submit your solutions by placing them on your web sites.
   Be sure that you are on the class mailing list,
   as refinements and hints for the assignments will be sent through email.
   Assignments will be checked immediately after the due date;
   if you finish an assignment late,
   <b>you must inform us by email when it is ready for us to grade it</b>.
   Changing an assignment after the due date without prior permission
   will be treated as a late submission.

   <p>

   Programs will be graded on style and formatting as well as correctness.
</div>

<p>
<dt> <b>HONOR CODE STATEMENT</b>:

<dd>
<div aLign="justify">
   As with all GMU courses,
   SWE 642 is governed by the <a href="../Honor.html">GMU Honor Code</a>.
   In this course, <b>all</b> assignments, exams, and project submissions
   carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the author,
   unless joint work is explicitly authorized.
   Help may be obtained from the instructor or other students to understand
   the description of the problem and any technology,
   but the solution, particularly the design portion,
   must be the student's own work.
   If joint work is authorized,
   all contributing students must be listed on the submission.
   Any deviation from this is considered an Honor Code violation,
   and as a minimum, will result in failure of the submission
   and as a maximum, failure of the class.

</div>


<p>
<dt> <b>DISABILITIES</b>:
<dd>

<div aLign="justify">
   If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
   please see me and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at 993-2474.
   All academic accommodations must be arranged through the DRC.
</div>


<p>
<dt><b>GRADING POLICIES</b>:

<dd>
<div align="justify">
   <ul>
   <li>There will be several computer programming assignments (total 30%)
   <li>Each class (except the first one) will have a quiz
   in the <b>first 15 minutes</b> of classtime.
       You are allowed to miss up to three quizzes
       (the lowest three quiz grades will be dropped).
       The 10 quizzes with the highest scores will be
       used to calculate the final grade (10 * 3% = 30%)
   <li>There will be a closed-book, in-class, comprehensive final (40%)
   </ul>
