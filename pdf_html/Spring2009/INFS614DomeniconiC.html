     <blockquote>

     <li> <b>General</b>: Oracle database management system is installed in an IT&E
          Unix server, accessible from Rooms ST2-12, ST2-133, ST2-137. 
          It is also available via network or modem.

     <li> <b>Accessing Oracle</b>: An Oracle account has been created for all students enrolled in this class. Each student should have received an e-mail with the instructions to set up his/her account. The same instructions can also be found 
             <a href="http://ite.gmu.edu/labs">here</a>
             (Click on FAQ's). Basically, go to <a href="https://access.ite.gmu.edu">https://access.ite.gmu.edu</a> and select Oracle from the menu bar on the right. The link also gets to the VPN client download to connect to zeus from home.
             To verify that your account has been set, login to <em>zeus.ite.gmu.edu</em>,
             and type <em>sqlplus</em>. If you get the Oracle prompt SQL>, your account is ready
             to go; otherwise send an email to the Oracle administrator.

    <li> <b>Working with Oracle</b>: You may find this small 
            <a href="http://ise.gmu.edu/~ami/teaching/infs614/current/oracle.html">primer</a> useful, as it
            provides information of our particular computing environment.
