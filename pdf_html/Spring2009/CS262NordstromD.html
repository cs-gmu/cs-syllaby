<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>
The text is Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, <i>The C Programming Language</i>, 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 1988.
</p>
<h3>The course</h3>

<p>
Most high-level programming languages (and particularly Java) insulate the 
programmer from the realities of the hardware on which the programs will
run.  C is the exception since it was originally designed to implement
the Unix operating system.  C offers the programmer direct access to much
of the underlying hardware and, for programs running under Unix, direct
access to operating system services.  For these reasons C remains the
language of choice for systems programming.
</p>

<p>
This is a (short) course on "low-level" programming using C.  We will
learn C with heavy emphasis on pointer operations.
</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

Planned topics include:
<ul>
<li>C Types, Operators, and Expressions</li>
<li>Control Flow</li>
<li>Functions and Program Structures</li>
<li>Pointers and Arrays</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
<li>Structures</li>
<li>Bitwise operations</li>
<li>Input and Output Libraries</li>
<li>The Unix System Interface</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Course outcomes</h3>

<p>
The students will:
<ul>
<li>Be able to implement, test and debug a designed solution to a problem in a “low-level” programming language, specifically the C programming language.
</li>
<li>Demonstrate a good understanding of C language constructs such as pointers,
dynamic memory management, and address arithmetic.
</li>
<li>Demonstrate a good understanding of C libraries for input and output, and the
interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system.
</li>
<li>Demonstrate an ability to use UNIX tools for program development and
debugging.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Programs</h3>

<p>
There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website
</p>

<p>
You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>,
and the University honor code: <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu">http://honorcode.gmu.edu
</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</p>

<p>
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate ate my program" are <i>not</i>
reasons for late submissions).
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</p>

<ul>
<li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</ul>
