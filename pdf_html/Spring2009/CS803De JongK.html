        This course will serve as an introduction to and comprehensive
        survey of the rapidly growing field of evolutionary computation.
        The course will cover in some detail the main paradigms, including
        genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and evolutionary
        programming.  These basic evolutionary algorithms will be studied
        both empirically and theoretically, and their usefulness relative
        to other more traditional algorithms will be analyzed for a variety
        of problem domains.  In addition, their relationship to the field of
        Meta-heuristics and the field of Natural Computation will be explored.

        There will be regular homework assignments, primarily computational 
        and will involve programming.

        A final term project will be required.
