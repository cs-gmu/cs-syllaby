    <p><b>DESCRIPTION: </b>CS 222 is a second course in computer programming,
      emphasizing programming concepts relevant to engineers. Topics include
      lower level language aspects and elementary data structures. Students are
      expected to have a basic understanding of the elements of programming in
      some high-level language. CS 222 will be taught using C, but students are
      not presumed to be familiar with C prior to this class. This course is
      intended as a terminal course in programming for engineers.</p>
    <p><i>Prerequisite: C or better in CS 112.</i> </p>

    <p> <b>COURSE POLICIES</b> </p>
    <p><i>Class:</i> Class lectures will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays, from
      9:00 a.m. - 10:15 a.m.&nbsp;each day. Students are expected to attend the
      full lecture each week and are responsible for all material covered during
      lecture.</p>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Electronic Devices:<span style="font-style: italic;">
          &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>Use of
      electronic devices (including laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.) is not
      permitted during class except during specific class activities.
      &nbsp;Please make sure all such devices are turned off or silenced while
      class is in session. </p>
    <p><i>Programming Assignments:</i> Programming assignments will be posted on
      Blackboard as they are assigned, and must be submitted on Blackboard by
      the assigned due date. &nbsp;Rubrics will typically be provided for major
      assignments and should be consulted to be sure specifications are met.
      &nbsp;If your program is incomplete, you may still submit it for partial
      credit. However, <b>your code must run without obvious errors (even if
        not all functionality is present)</b>. Building your programs in a
      modular fashion and debugging as you go are crucial concepts in program
      development. Additionally, your TA relies on running your program as part
      of your grade determination.&nbsp; <b>Accordingly, any programming
        assignment that is submitted but either does not compile or has major
        errors when it is run will receive no more than 50% credit.</b> </p>
    <p>Students are expected to work independently outside of class to
      familiarize themselves with the GMU computer systems, to read and review
      all assigned materials and to complete all homework and programming
      projects. </p>
    <p><i>Reading</i>: Students are responsible for reading and understanding
      all assigned material. Be aware that some material covered in class may
      not be found in your textbook. &nbsp;If you do not understand any of the
      covered material or reading assignments, there will be opportunities to
      ask questions in class, on Piazza or during UTA/GTA/instructor office
      hours. </p>
    <p><i>Due Dates</i>: Due dates for all programming projects will be posted
      on Blackboard. Programming assignments are posted in advance, and are due
      in the manner stated in the specs (usually electronic submission through
      Blackboard) no later than the date specified. &nbsp;Homework assignments
      are due in the manner stated (either through Blackboard or in class.) </p>
    <p><i>Late work</i>:&nbsp; Late submissions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span>
      permitted for homework and programming projects,&nbsp;but will be
      penalized 10% per day (incl. weekend days/holidays). You should recognize
      that this can cause major penalties for incomplete programs, so start work
      early! If your program isn't the way you'd like it to be when the deadline
      is near, submit it anyway for partial credit. <b>In fact, submit early
        and often! </b> The system permits you to&nbsp;resubmit your assignment
      until the due date, so you may resubmit if you improve your program prior
      to the deadline. (Resubmissions after the deadline require approval of
      your TA, since s/he may already have graded your project. If you know that
      you wish to resubmit a new version after the deadline, it is your
      responsibility to notify your TA no later than the time of the deadline,
      so s/he will not grade the on-time submission.) No resubmissions may be
      made after a project has been graded. </p>
    <hr><b>GRADING POLICY</b>
    <p>Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following items: </p>
    <ul>
      <tt>
        <li>programming projects (30% total)</li>
      </tt> <tt>
        <li>homework(25% total)</li>
        <li>quizzes/in-class activities (5%)</li>
      </tt> <tt>
        <li>midterm exam (15%)&nbsp;</li>
      </tt> <tt>
        <li>final examination (25%)</li>
      </tt>
    </ul>
    <p>Individual programming projects may be weighted differently from one
      another, at the instructor's discretion. </p>
    <p>Instructor's evaluation may include in-class exercises. &nbsp;Homework
      may include short programming assignments and/or&nbsp;traditional homework
      exercises. &nbsp; </p>
    <hr><b>CLASS COMMUNICATIONS</b>
    <p>CS 222 will be using Blackboard and GMU email for most class
      communications. We will also be using Piazza as a forum for questions you
      may have about assignments or the course in general. &nbsp;You are
      responsible for any announcements or information posted on Blackboard or
      Piazza, either by your instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s).
      &nbsp;Since most Blackboard announcements will also be sent to your gmu
      email account, please make sure your GMU email account is active and able
      to receive messages.&nbsp; Individual communications with the
      professor/GTA/UTA should also use&nbsp;your GMU email account. When you
      send email, please be sure to include your name, the class number and
      section and the topic in the subject header. (E.g.: Subject: Jim Jones /
      CS 222-002 / Project 2) </p>
    <hr> <b>OFFICE OF DISABILITY SERVICES<br>
      <br>
    </b>If you are a student with a disability, please contact the Office of
    Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. &nbsp;I will be happy to
    arrange any appropriate academic accommodations, but they must be arranged
    through ODS (http://ods.gmu.edu).<br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><b>PROGRAMMING POLICIES</b>
    <p>(1) <b>No sharing or discussion of code for assignments</b>.&nbsp;Unless
      specifically stated otherwise, all assignments are individual projects,
      not group projects. Students are expected to do their own work, not to
      share programs with each other, nor copy programs from anyone else. This
      means you may not discuss program design or strategize solutions with
      anyone except your instructor or a course UTA or GTA.<b> </b>&nbsp;However,
      you may offer more limited assistance to your fellow students regarding
      specific questions on their programming assignments by responding to
      queries on Blackboard or Piazza (see guidelines below). &nbsp;You may also
      discuss general course concepts, including coding, so long as it is&nbsp;
      outside of any assignment context. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any
        discussion or sharing of code outside these guidelines constitutes an
        honor code violation</span>. Suspected honor code violations are taken
      very seriously, and will be reported to the Honor Committee. (See the <span
        style="color: blue;"></span><a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
        Department Honor Code</a> and the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU_Honor
        Code</a>) </p>
    <p>(2) <b>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</b><i>.</i>
      You may <u>not</u> incorporate code written by others, such as code that
      can be found on the Internet or in any of the numerous CS books available.
      You are encouraged to use external sources to enhance your understanding
      of general concepts, but you should not be using these sources to locate
      code to include in any assigned programs. &nbsp;Of course, you may freely
      use any code provided as part of the project specifications, and you need
      not credit the source. &nbsp;However, if you use code provided by your
      instructor/GTA/UTA (other than that given as part of the project
      specifications) or from the course textbook, you must document what
      portion came from those sources. &nbsp;Working something out together with
      an instructor or TA usually will not require crediting the source, but
      when in doubt, simply ask to make sure.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>(3) <b>Piazza</b>. We encourage the use of Piazza to discuss assignments
      and assist one another with programming questions. You may ask questions
      or respond to queries regarding projects or other assignments, <b>so long
        as you do not post any C code or detailed pseudo code, and so long as
        you do not provide specific solutions to the overall problem or
        algorithm design (even in English)</b>. Often, students believe that
      posting "simple" code is acceptable. However, because there is a wide
      variation in what different students and instructors regard as "simple,"
      we must be very strict about the ban against posting code on Piazza. <b>Only</b>
      an instructor, GTA or UTA is permitted to place code on blackboard/piazza
      unless it is code that has already been provided to all students (either
      as part of the assignment specification itself or within the class
      textbook - in which case the source should be stated as part of the
      posting). </p>
    <p>(4) <b>Discussing Blackboard/Piazza postings outside of
        Blackboard/Piazza.</b> &nbsp;Students must not discuss postings from
      Blackboard/Piazza outside of the electronic system. &nbsp;"Summarizing"
      Blackboard statements or responses to another student verbally regarding
      an assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject to the above ban on
      discussing assignment solutions. While it may seem harmless, Blackboard
      and Piazza were set up so that all assistance could be overseen by
      instructors/TAs/UTAs, and it is nearly impossible to truly duplicate this
      type of discussion outside of the system itself, thus creating the
      potential for either (unknown) mistaken advice, or for unfair advantage by
      certain students. If you truly wish to assist a fellow student, encourage
      him or her to log onto Blackboard/Piazza, and direct him/her to specific
      postings you find helpful. </p>
    <p>(5) <b>Back up your program regularly.</b> You are expected to backup
      your program in separate files as you get different pieces working.
      Failure to do this may result in your getting a much lower grade on a
      program if last minute problems occur. (Accidentally deleting your
      program, having problems connecting, etc., will <u>not</u> be accepted as
      excuses for missing the posted due date/time for assignments.) </p>
    <p>(6) <b>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</b>. It is
      important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final
      submission. If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit
      will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not
      changed after being submitted. </p>
    <p>(7) <b>Code must run on zeus using gcc</b>. Students are strongly
      encouraged to develop programs directly on zeus, and must test them before
      submission to be sure they work properly using the gcc compiler on zeus.
      &nbsp;Students who choose to disregard this advice and develop their
      programs on other systems should not be surprised&nbsp;if their programs
      fail to work on zeus. &nbsp;Also, please note that the instructor or TAs
      may not be able to answer questions regarding errors encountered on other
      systems. &nbsp;Once makefiles are introduced, a makefile should also be
      included with each assignment submission. &nbsp;No credit will be given
      for nonworking programs claimed to work elsewhere, and no extensions will
      be given due to compiler incompatibilities.</p>
    <hr><b><br>
      CLASS SCHEDULE</b>
    <p>The class schedule will be posted online to the Blackboard course.&nbsp;

      class. </p>
