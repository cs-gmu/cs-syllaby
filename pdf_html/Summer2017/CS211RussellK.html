	<h3>TEXTBOOK</h3>
	<p>Required: Zyante Zybook (code will be posted on Pizza)</p>
	<p>Required: Lab Manual (sections will be posted online on the course Piazza site for free download). 
	<p>Optional: Building Java Programs, 3rd ed., by Reges and Stepp.</p>
	
	<h3>SOFTWARE &amp; PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<p>You will need a computer for this class with some modern operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember that lab computers are also available on campus, see campus resources below.</p>
	<p>The prerequisite for this course is CS 112 or its equivalent with a grade of C or better. I will assume a "semester's worth" of programming experience. You should understand basic programming including program design, debugging techniques, exception handling, and basic classes and objects.</p>

	<h3>COURSE OUTCOMES</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>An understanding of basic object-oriented (OO) programming concepts and principles.</li>
		<li>An ability to apply basic object-oriented principles and techniques in the development of software systems using a specific programming language.</li>
		<li>An ability to effectively develop software systems using both basic command line tools and sophisticated integrated development environments, and to understand the advantages and limitations of each.</li>
		<li>An ability to successfully perform debugging operations and techniques.</li>
		<li>An ability to perform software development in both individual and team environments.</li>
		<li>An understanding of programming-related references/resources available to software developers and the ability to use them effectively – both in ongoing projects and in the acquisition of new technical skills.</li>
		<li>An understanding of how acquired programming skills facilitate success in upper level CS courses and in various professional environments.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>OVERVIEW OF CLASS COMPONENTS & REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lectures - During lectures we will discuss programming concepts and provide demos of programming relevant to other course work. </li>
		<li>Labs (General) - Labs meet twice per week and attendance is required for the full period. Labs alternate between Exercises/Tasks and Quizzes.</li>
		<li>Lab Exercises/Tasks - Lab exercises/tasks are open resource and open collaboration. Labs MUST be completed in lab unless otherwise noted (the lab is 50 minutes, not 50+ minutes).</li>
		<li>Lab Quizzes - Lab Quizzes are open note (but not "open computer"), you must print or hand write any notes you need. Quizzes are INDIVIDUAL work and NO COLLABORATION is allowed. Quizzes are treated like mini-open-note-exams.</li>
		<li>Readings - It is assumed that students read the scheduled sections prior to each lab quiz. Zyante readings are graded based on the completion percentage <b>before the designated deadline</b> of each chapter. Make sure you're logged in to get credit.</li>
    	<li>Office Hours - In addition to attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you learn.</li>
		<li>Programming Assignments - Students will receive a number of programming projects during the semester. Each project will involve writing programs and answering questions about them to illustrate an understanding of course material. Programming projects are INDIVIDUAL work and NO COLLABORATION is allowed.</li>
		<li>Exams - There will one midterm exam during the regularly scheduled lecture time. There will also be a comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester. Refer to the schedule for dates of the exams.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>FINAL GRADES</h3>
	<p>Final grades will be assigned without rounding according to the following criteria. It is a 10-point scale per letter grade, with the upper and lower 2% of each 10% earning a + or -. For example:</p>
	<table border=1 style="border-collapse: collapse">
		<tr>
			<th>Letter Grade</th>
			<th>Score Required</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A+</td>
			<td>98% and up</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A</td>
			<td>92-97%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A-</td>
			<td>90-91%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B+</td>
			<td>88-89%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B</td>
			<td>82-87%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B-</td>
			<td>80-81%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C+</td>
			<td>78-79%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>72-77%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C-</td>
			<td>70-71</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>D</td>
			<td>60-69%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>below 60%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Note: per departmental policy, a failing grade on the final exam (&lt;60.0%) will result in a failing grade (F) for the entire course, regardless of performance on other assignments and graded materials.</p>
	<p>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.</p>
	<p>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your semester-long progress.</p>

	<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
    <p>Programming projects will be a primary focus of your grade - each
      one should take multiple sessions of coding, with questions asked
      in between. This is the practice you need to learn, master, and
      internalize various concepts of the course. Don't be surprised if
      you're spending 5-20 hours on each one. All project grades will be
      averaged together evenly.
    </p>
    
	<p>All projects are to be submitted to Blackboard. You can
	  submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
	  and by default only the last version will be graded. Turning
	  in the wrong files will likely result in a zero. You
	  can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that
	  you turned in a working copy.
    </p>
	
	<p>Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in
          a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
          somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the
          student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the
          deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</p>
		  
	<p>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
          extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
          service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
          it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
          stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
          forgot to (frequently) back up your work!</p>
		  
	<p>Any code turned in that does not compile, specifically on
          Java 1.8 is likely to receive a zero. If the grader
		  is able to quickly fix your code, you may get some points
		  (but you will automatically lose 10 points PER FIX).
		  If the grader cannot immediately spot and fix the issue,
		  the assignment will receive a zero, no exceptions.</p>
    
	<h3>LATE TOKENS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each student gets <b>three</b> Late-One-Day tokens, which
          are automatically used by late submissions.
		</li>
		<li>Turning in 1 minute late and turning in 23 hours and 59 
		  minutes late are treated the same. No "half" tokens.
		</li>
        <li>At most one late token can be used per project.
		</li>
        <li>Tokens are only allowed on projects; they can't be used on labs.
        </li>
        <li>Unused late-tokens will be worth a small bounty at the
          semester's end (0.25% of the semester grade).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Turning in a project late without a token, or turning in
		  a project more than 24 hours late, will result in a zero. No exceptions.
		</li>
    </ul>
	
	<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h3>
	<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions. The work you submit should be the product of your own effort and reflect your personal understanding.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code or exam solutions they submit. Inability to do so will be construed as evidence of misconduct.</p>

	<p>Both the University and the Computer Science Department have honor codes you are expected to adhere to. We will be reviewing these in class, but more information about the university honor code can be found here: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/</a> and the deparment's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/</a>. You are bound by these honor codes.</p>
	<p>Any submitted work which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors Committee. Any code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the project may be included in your programs.</p>
	
	<p>
	Programming projects are considered individual efforts,
	therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of problem
	solutions are allowed with anyone except the TAs or the
	professor. Student projects will be manually and automatically
	assessed for cheating. <b><font color="#cc0000">You may not
	look at or otherwise view any other individual's code,
	pseudocode, or algorithms.</font></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	You may not use any Internet resources to create code or
	algorithms, besides the textbooks, the slides, and Piazza,
	unless otherwise specified. However, you are free to look up
	the syntax errors your encounter online, to gain an
	understanding of what the syntax error means. The projects
	we're doing this semester can be directly solved using
	techniques discussed in class, and no outside material is
	needed unless otherwise noted.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
	a password, to not post your code to websites like Pastebin
	that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
	computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
	computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
	your code.
	</p>
