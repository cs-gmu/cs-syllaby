  <p></p><h3>Course Description:</h3> 
  CS 571 provides an introduction to the principles of operating systems
 theory and practice. Fundamental concepts such as processes, 
synchronization, scheduling, memory management, file systems, 
distributed systems, and security will be presented.<p></p>
  
  <p>This course will prepare you for further courses in the Systems and Networking area, to include <b>CS 635 (Foundations of Parallel Computation)</b>, <b>CS 672 (Computer System Performance Evaluation)</b>, and <b>CS 675 (Distributed Systems)</b>, among others.</p>

  <h3>Textbook</h3>
  <p>In this class, the main resource for the material will be the 
lectures and slides delivered by the instructor.  There are many, many 
different ways to approach these topics, and each operating system (and 
each different version or that code) may support completely different 
implementations. The lectures are the primary resource for the course.</p>

  <p><b>Required Textbook:</b> "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (Online Book, Arpaci-Dusseau Books) by R.H. Arpaci-Dusseau and A.C. Arpaci-Dusseau.</p><p>

  </p><ul>
    <li>All programming in this course will be done in the C programming
 language.  This book provides a good reference for C that may be 
helpful during the course.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Additional Resources:</b> The following older textbooks also are
 good resources.  These are not required, but if you would like 
additional references that cover the same topics, a recent edition of 
any of the following books will present in-depth discussions on the core
 topics.

  <h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>Systems Programming</b> class.  Unlike a 
general-purpose C courses for any computer system, this course is based 
on building programs for a specific system.  For CS 571, that system is 
an emulated server that is running Zeus. </p>

  <p>Zeus is a Linux computer running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is 
administerd by the College of Engineering and Computing for our use.  
Some of our programs will involve libraries that have been pre-built on

<!--[HONOR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id="honor" class="main">
  <h2>Academic Standards (Honor Code)</h2>

  <p>Academic Standards exist to promote authentic scholarship, support 
the institution’s goal of maintaining high standards of academic 
excellence, and encourage continued ethical behavior of faculty and 
students to cultivate an educational community which values integrity 
and produces graduates who carry this commitment forward into 
professional practice.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As members of the George Mason University community, we are 
committed to fostering an environment of trust, respect, and scholarly 
excellence. Our academic standards are the foundation of this 
commitment, guiding our behavior and interactions within this academic 
community. The practices for implementing these standards adapt to 
modern practices, disciplinary contexts, and technological advancements.
 Our standards are embodied in our courses, policies, and scholarship, 
and are upheld in the following principles:&nbsp;</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Honesty:&nbsp;</strong>Providing accurate information in all academic endeavors, including communications, assignments, and examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  
    <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong>&nbsp;Giving proper credit for 
all contributions to one’s work. This involves the use of accurate 
citations and references for any ideas, words, or materials created by 
others in the style appropriate to the discipline. It also includes 
acknowledging shared authorship in group projects, co-authored pieces, 
and project reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Uniqueness of Work:</strong>&nbsp;Ensuring that all 
submitted work is the result of one’s own effort and is original, 
including free from self-plagiarism. This principle extends to written 
assignments, code, presentations, exams, and all other forms of academic
 work.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Violations of these standards—including but not limited to 
plagiarism, fabrication, and cheating—are taken seriously and will be 
addressed in accordance with university policies. The process for 
reporting, investigating, and adjudicating violations is <a href="https://academicstandards.gmu.edu/">outlined in the university’s procedures</a>.
 Consequences of violations may include academic sanctions, disciplinary
 actions, and other measures necessary to uphold the integrity of our 
academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The principles outlined in these academic standards reflect our 
collective commitment to upholding the highest standards of honesty, 
acknowledgement, and uniqueness of work. By adhering to these 
principles, we ensure the continued excellence and integrity of George 
Mason University’s academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Student responsibility:&nbsp;</strong>Students are 
responsible for understanding how these general expectations regarding 
academic standards apply to each course, assignment, or exam they 
participate in; students should ask their instructor for clarification 
on any aspect that is not clear to them<em>.</em></p>

  <p>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or 
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply 
will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work 
from a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to 
compare your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use 
automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by 
hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Academic Standards 
Office. Repeat to yourself: it's not worth trying to cheat. We will 
catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.</p>

  <p><b>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The usual Sanction applied is Level 2 (Failure in the course).</b></li>
    <li>It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a semester and lose some 
implicated friends; please don't put yourself through that experience!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sexual Harassment and Interpersonal Violence Policies</h2>

  <p>As a part of George Mason University’s commitment to providing a 
safe and non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment 
for all members of the University community, the University does not 
discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or 
employment programs and activities. Accordingly,&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;non-
confidential employees, including your faculty member, have a legal 
requirement to report to the Title IX Coordinator, all relevant details 
obtained directly or indirectly about any incident of Prohibited Conduct</strong>&nbsp;
(such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, gender-based stalking, 
dating/domestic violence). Upon notifying the Title IX Coordinator of 
possible Prohibited Conduct, the Title IX Coordinator will assess the 
report and determine if outreach is required. If outreach is required, 
the individual the report is about (the “Complainant”) will receive a 
communication, likely in the form of an email, offering that person the 
option to meet with a representative of the Title IX office.</p>

  <p>For more information about non-confidential employees, resources, and Prohibited Conduct, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/sexual-harassment-policy/">University Policy 1202</a>:
 Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct and Other Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence. Questions regarding Title IX can be directed to the Title IX 
Coordinator via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:TitleIX@gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TitleIX@gmu.edu</a>, by phone at 703-993-8730, or in person on the Fairfax campus in Aquia 373.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Student opportunity</strong>: &nbsp;If you prefer to speak to someone&nbsp;<strong><em>confidentially</em></strong>, please contact one of Mason’s confidential employees in Student Support and Advocacy (<a href="https://ssac.gmu.edu/">SSAC</a>), Counseling and Psychological Services (<a href="https://caps.gmu.edu/">CAPS</a>), Student Health Services (<a href="https://shs.gmu.edu/">SHS</a>), and/or the&nbsp;<a href="https://ombuds.gmu.edu/">Office of the University Ombudsperson</a>.</p>
