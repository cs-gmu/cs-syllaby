<p><h3>Meets</h3>Tuesday, 4:30&ndash;7:10 PM, in Exploratory Hall L003.

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke.</a>

<p><h3>Prerequisite</h3> CS480, CS580, or an equivalent class taught at another university.  This is a hard prerequisite: generally students who have not met this prerequisite will fail CS687 and become sad.

<p><h3>About the Class</h3> This course will cover several advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence beyond those covered in CS580. These topics will extend existing knowledge about search, machine learning, reasoning, and situated action. Some topics are required; others may be negotiated with the class. Topics may include planning, probabilistic reasoning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, advanced neural networks, natural language processing, constraint satisfaction, reactive systems, knowledge-based learning, robotics, vision, emergent behavior, and intelligent multiagent systems.

<p>AI is a very broad field, and the goal of this course is to provide the student with sufficient breadth beyond CS580 to act as a well-versed AI researcher.  Informally, CS580 + CS687 try to cover all the topics that might show up on the Ph.D. Qualifying Exam.

<p>All programming assignments will be done in Common Lisp, the traditional exploratory programming language of AI.  Assignments will also be done by teams of students.  Often but not always Common Lisp is taught in CS580, but some students may not have learned it, so we'll have to teach it.

<p><h3>Grading</h3> 
This course will consist largely of several large projects and two exams. The breakdown will be approximately:
<span class="list">1.</span> Homework and (several) Projects: 50% with higher weight given to harder projects.</span>
<span class="list">2.</span>Exams (2 of them): 25% Each

<p><h3>Course Outcomes</h3> 
<div>
<span class="list">1.</span> An ability to employ various basic machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, search, knowledge representation, and planning techniques. <span class="list">2.</span> An ability to use Lisp at a moderate to high level of proficiency.  <span class="list">3.</span> An ability to develop nontrivial artificial intellience applications.  <span class="list">4.</span> An ability to work in teams.  <span class="list">5.</span> An ability to identify the right AI technique to use for a given problem, and to understand the issues and tradeoffs involved.
