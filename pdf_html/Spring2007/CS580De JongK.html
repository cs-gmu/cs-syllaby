Course Text:    Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd edition)
                     by Russell &amp; Norvig, Prentice Hall Publishing

Supplementary texts:
                ANSI Common Lisp, Graham, Prentice-Hall
                Common LISPcraft, R. Wilensky, Norton Publishing
                Common Lisp - The Language, G. Steele, Digital Press
                Prolog Programming, Clocksin &amp; Mellish, Springer-Verlag
                Artificial Intelligence Through Prolog, N. Rowe, Prentice Hall
                Symbolic Computing with Lisp &amp; Prolog, Mueller &amp; Page, Wiley Publ.

Prequisites:    A working knowledge of computer systems and several
                programming languages is required.  The material covered
                in CS 312 and Math 305 as well as general computer science
                maturity is assumed and used throughout the course.

Content:        The basic principles of representation, heuristic search,
                and control will be presented in the context of specific
                AI areas such as problem solving, vision, natural language,
                and expert systems.  The Lisp programming language will be
                used as the primary language for homework assignments.
                Some exposure to logic programming via Prolog is planned.

Exams:          There will be a midterm and final exam.

Homework:       There will be 4-6 programming assignments which will
                include written summaries.  A class project will be required.

Grading:        The course grade will be determined approximately as follows:

                        homework:       40%
                        project:        10%
                        midterm:        20%
                        final:          30%
