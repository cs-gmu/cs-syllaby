<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Overview</font></b><br>  
<font face="Times New Roman">This course will cover advanced techniques of language processing.&nbsp; Emphasis will be on 
analysis and optimizations in construction of compilers 
for high performances. There 
are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this 
course.&nbsp; Tentative topics include:</font><ul>
	<li>Data-flow and control-flow analysis</li>
	<li>Global optimization (inter- and intra-procedural)</li>
	<li>Code generation</li>
	<li>Generation and optimization for parallel, OO and functional programming 
	environments </li>
</ul>

<b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Prerequisites: CS540 and CS583 or 
equivalent.</font></b><br>
<font face="Times New Roman">Students are expected to be familiar with 
compilation process and standard skills in constructing compiler front-ends.&nbsp; </font>
In order to be able to work on the programming projects, students <i><b>must</b>
</i>be comfortable with Java programming language. You are encouraged to 
contact the instructor if you have concerns about the working language.

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grading Policies</font></b><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman">Tentative plans call for 3 to 4 programming assignments, together 
  worth 45% of your grade. These are to be individual efforts, meaning no sharing 
  of code allowed with anyone but the instructor or the TA. Expect substantial 
  programming workload. 
  <!--There will also be written homeworks, an in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. Both exams are closed-book 
  and closed-notes. </font>The final exam will be <b>comprehensive</b> and will 
cover the whole course. --></font>Both the final and midterm exams are 
closed-book and closed-notes.&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Missed exams 
must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the 
illness (doctor's note) is required.&nbsp; No early exams will be given and 
make-up exams are strongly discouraged.&nbsp; Tentative </font>grade 
distribution is: programming projects: 45%, midterm: 20%, final: 35%.&nbsp; 
Letter grades will be assigned by subjectively identifying brackets in the 
numeric scores.&nbsp; A total score of 49 or less will result in F.&nbsp; </p>
<font face="Times New Roman">
<!--<p><font face="Times New Roman">Tentative breakdown of the end-of-semester numeric score 
is as follows: 
  </font> </p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">60% Assignments</li></font><UL>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">45% programming 
assignments</font><LI><font face="Times New Roman">15% written assignments</font></UL>

<font face="Times New Roman">Letter grades will be assigned by subjectively identifying brackets 
in the numeric scores. </font>A score below 50% will result in an F. 
-->
<p><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy</b><br>
<b>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION FOR ILLNESS</b>, with the following exception: 
every student of the course is allowed to have a total of <b>3 FREE LATE DAYS</b>.&nbsp; Consider them as non-transferable, non-replaceable credits and use them wisely.&nbsp; If you wish to use one or more of these, indicate it clearly in your submission.&nbsp; No partial late day is in effect. You need one whole late day to cover a one-hour 
late submission.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be graded if you have used all three 
late days.&nbsp; <b>Partial credits</b> are available as long as you document well which 
parts have been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Extra Credit</font></b><br>
There may be opportunities for extra credit on some of the projects 
or exams.&nbsp; To receive any extra credit for a project, all base functionality 
of a project must be implemented; extra credit portions of a project can not count 
in place of required features.&nbsp; Extra extensions other than your late days 
will not be given for completion of extra credit.<p> <b> <font color="#D50000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Honor Code</font></b><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman">You are expected to abide by the honor code. All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Collaborations on any programming assignment 
	is unacceptable.&nbsp; Please refer to </font><A HREF="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">
<font face="Times New Roman">GMU 
  Academic Policies</font></A><font face="Times New Roman"> and </font> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
<font face="Times New Roman">Computer 
  Science Department Honor Code</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">.
</font>Any violation of the honor code will result in a zero of the 
	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class.
