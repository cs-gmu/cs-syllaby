<p>PROGRAMMING PROJECTS and LAB ASSIGNMENTS: Will be posted on WebCT and
submitted through WebCT.</p><hr>
  QUIZZES WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED BEFOREHAND<br>
  <hr>
   <br>

Lab time will be your opportunity to: <p></p>
<ul> <li> become accustomed to the GMU computing environment             
            </li><li> learn how to submit labs and
projects</li><li> gain an introduction and ask questions about labs and 
programming assignments </li></ul>

Lab attendance is <em>required</em>. Failure to attend
lab will result in significant loss of both instruction and hands-on
experience.&nbsp;In addition, quizzes or in-lab assignments may not be made up.
During lab time, your lab instructor will provide examples and assistance with
concepts covered in the book and during lecture, and occasionally will introduce
new material as well.&nbsp; Accordingly, you should fully prepare yourself for
lab by attending lectures and completing any assigned reading, as well as
carefully reviewing and, in appropriate cases, getting started on the lab
assignments provided in advance.  Lab will also provide the opportunity
to work on the GMU computer systems in a controlled environment&nbsp; and
to ask more detailed questions than may be possible during your lecture.

<p><strong>Lab assignments  are due via electronic
submission on the Saturday following  your scheduled lab in which they were
presented before midnight (11:59 PM).</strong>
</p>
<p>Please note that you must attend the lab session you are registered
for.&nbsp; You may be able to attend
another lab session if it is tied to your lecture session if your instructor
agrees;&nbsp; however, individual
instructors may vary both lab materials and lab assignments.&nbsp;
Accordingly, attendance at any lab
session not specifically connected with your lecture section cannot
be counted on to cover the same
material as those associated with your lecture section.&nbsp; In addition,
quizzes taken in another lab section
will not count towards your grade unless special arrangements were
made in advance and accepted by
both your instructor and TA.&nbsp; Accordingly, you should plan to
attend the lab session you are registered for.

<br><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<br>
<br> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A first course in computer science for majors and
others with a serious interest in computer science. Topics include an
overview of computer system hardware and organization, problem solving
methods and algorithm development, program structures, abstract data
types, simple data and file structures, introduction to analysis of
algorithmic complexity and program correctness, and applications
development in a high level language that supports modular design. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Prerequisite:</i>

Thorough understanding of high school algebra and trigonometry and
successful completion of Math Placement Test offered through the 
<st1:place><st1:placename>Testing</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> (i.e. student is eligible to 
take Math 113), or a grade of C or better in MATH 105. </p><p>CS 112 is an 
intensive, time-consuming, 4 unit class intended for CSmajors, CS minors, and 
students in engineering and/or mathematics.While students in the IT minor 
program <i>may</i> take CS 112, they are strongly advised to take IT 108
instead. Beginners with little exposure to computers should consider taking IT
103 or IT 108. CS 112 is taught using Java in a Unix environment. Lab attendance 
isrequired.<br>  <br>  <br>

<p>
<i>Reading</i>: Students are responsible for reading and understanding the
material in the textbook. However, we will not necessarily cover all of it in
class. If you do not understand something in the book, there will be opportunity
to ask questions in class, during your instructor's office hours, or those of
thecourse TAs.
You may see any TA assigned to this course, regardless of whether she/he is your
lab instructor. <br><br>

<strong><i>Due Dates</i>: Labs are due before midnight on the Saturday
after the lab period in which they are presented. Programming projects will
be due the assigned date and time. Work will be submitted
electronically using WebCT. A project may only be sumitted once.  Do not attempt
to resubmit a project if you have already made one submission for
this project.</strong><br></p>

<p><strong><em>Late work</em>: Late labs will not be accepted. Late
projects will be penalized 10 points per day, but will not be accepted
more than 3 days late. (if you received a 90 on the project but it was
3 days late, your score would be 90 - 30 = 60). After that projects will
not be graded.  No
extra credit points, when available, will be given to late projects.
Individual requests for extensions will not be granted. However, you
will receive partial credit for any portions of your program that you
can demonstrate work correctly.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <i>Missing an Exam or Contesting a grade</i>: Once labs or projects
grades are sent to you, you have one week to contest the grade. After
that the grade will not be changed. You must have a written excuse
(doctor's note, for example) to miss an exam. Once a test or quiz is
returned, you have one week to contest the grade-- beyond that the
grade will not be changed. Note that the week starts when a test is
returned to the class, which may or may not be when you choose to pick
yours up. The Dean's permission is required for taking a missed Final
Exam.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Incomplete</i>: A request for an incomplete (IN) will only
be considered in the final quarter of the course (all assignments up to
and including the 3rd project must have been turned in and no
additional work on these will be accepted). Request must be made in
writing, accompanied by a note from a doctor or employer and applicable
contact information. <br>

<p> We will use WebCt and Unix e-mail for official communication. You
are responsible for checking the system regularly for notices from your
instructor or TA. </p>
<p>1. You MUST obtain a Mason mail account if you do not have one. 
<a href="http://ite.gmu.edu/labs"> Click here and then on the "New Student" link 
to activate your Mason mail account</a> (The TA's will help you obtain an 
account and set up your WebCt account during a beginning lab session.) Please 
use your GMU mail account for any individual correspondence with your 
instructorand/or TA.&nbsp; (GMU faculty members have been instructed not to 
respondto student email originating from a non-GMU account.)&nbsp; </p><p>2.Your 
WebCT account will be set up automatically if you are properlyregistered for 
this class.&nbsp; Your WebCT ID will be identical toyour Mason e-mail (same as 
Mason cluster account) username.&nbsp; Ifyou registered at GMU on or after 
August 16, 2004, your initialpassword
will be based on your birth month, day and year. For example, a
birthday of February 16, 1987 would yield a password of 021687 If you
registered prior to this time, you initial password is the last four
digits of your SSN. Type webct38.gmu.edu into any browser to access
WebCt. </p>
<p>3. You will upload your assignments using the WebCT upload
system. Directions are in WebCT.<br>

<b> <a name="GRADING POLICY">GRADING POLICY</a></b> <br><br> <p>

Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following
items:
</p><ul>
<li> 3 programming projects -- 20% total
</li><li>labs -- 20%
</li><li> quizzes -- 15%
</li><li> 2 midterm exams -- 25% total
</li><li> Final exam -- 20%
</li></ul>

<p> Extra credit programming points do not carry over to test grade
points or vice-versa. Any student earning a "D" or "F" on the final
exam will receive a "D"or "F" in the class, at the discretion of the
instructor.
</p>

<br><br>

<hr> <br><br> <b> <a name="PROGRAMMING POLICIES">PROGRAMMING
POLICIES</a> </b> <br><br> <p> Programming projects may be weighted differently. 
These are to be <i>individual efforts</i>, meaning no code sharing or
discussion of problem solutions with anyone except your instructor or a
course UPA or TA. You may not incorporate code written by others, such
as can be found on the Internet or
any of the numerous CS books. Documentation is required.

</p><p> You <em>may</em>, however, ask questions
or respond to queries on WebCT regarding projects or other assignments,
so long as you do not post any code or pseudocode, and so long as you
do not provide specific solutions to the overall problem or algorithm design
(even in English). "Summarizing" WebCT statements or responses to another
student verbally regarding an assignment are <em>not</em> acceptable, and are
subject to the above ban on discussing assignment solutions.&nbsp; Such
discussion or code sharing constitutes an honor code violation. Suspected
honor code violations will be reported to the Honor Committee.&nbsp; (For
further information regarding honor code violations in programming, see
the Computer Science department's Honor Code statement.)
</p><p>During a lab session, with the TAs permission, you are allowed to
help a fellow student debug a program or answer very specific questions.
Allowing another student to copy your work or to copy that of another student,
is however, an Honor Code violation.

</p><p>


 You will be given credit only for code that works.  This means
that you should code and test functions as you write them, not code the
whole thing and then try to get it to work. Students may develop
programs using any computer system they have available.
 Please note, however, that submitted projects must run on jGrasp, unless 
otherwise specified by your instructor.</p>

<p> You are <em>expected</em> to backup
your program as you get different pieces working. Note that accidently deleting
your program, having problems connecting, etc., will not be accepted as excuses. 
 It is important that you <em>not</em> touch your programs once you have done
your submission: If there are submission problems, consideration for credit
will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not changed
after being submitted.
