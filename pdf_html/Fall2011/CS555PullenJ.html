</p><p><b>Current Catalog Description</b>
<br><b>Techniques and systems for communication of data between 
computational devices and layers of Internet Protocol Suite. Topics 
include role of various media and software components, local and wide 
area network protocols, network design, performance and cost 
considerations, and emerging advanced commercial technologies. 
Emphasizes TCP/IP family of protocols. </b>

<p><b>Course Outcomes</b>
<br>1. Explain basic electrical engineering principles that enable communication at the
physical layer
<br>2. Demonstrate an understanding of wired and wireless data link layer protocols for
shared medium and point-to-point communication
<br>3. Demonstrate an understanding of the graph theory concepts required for unicast
and multicast routing
<br>4. Demonstrate an understanding of distributed routing protocols
<br>5. Describe how protocols and applications use ARQ algorithms for distributed
reliability
<br>6. Demonstrate an understanding of end-to-end transport layer protocols

<br>* 40% Final exam



</p></b><p><b><b>Project: We will use the Java Network Workbench (JNW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the JNW environment, as described in the text by Pullen.

JNW is available for download from
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets">http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets</a>.
Well commented code must be submitted for grading via an upload
webpage at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle">http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle</a>.
Additional projects will be available for extra credit. Student problems with
the project are to be addressed to the TA, who may refer them the instructor as needed. </b>
Additional project information will be found at
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/JNWS">http://netlab.gmu.edu/JNWS</a>.</b>
</p><p>


</p><p><b>Project credit breakout: JDLC1, JDLC2, JDLC3, JLAN1, JWAN2, JTRN1, JTRN3 five
points each; extra credit assignment to be announced.</b>
</p><p><b>Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam
date.</b>
</p><p><b>Assignments are due by start of class on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit. No project submission will be accepted after reading day (12/12/2011).</b>
</p><p><b>All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
elaborated for Computer Science</a>. Students should be aware that their
submissions may be checked by plagiarism detection software.</b>
</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (but not higher than) A&nbsp; 93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B- 80; C 70.</b>
</p><p><b>Extra credit is available by doing an extra project; however, no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.</b> <br>&nbsp;
