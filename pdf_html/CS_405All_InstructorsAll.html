    <p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students
      culminate their undergraduate education in the field of computer science
      by examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding
      computer technology and its use and building a foundation for dealing with
      those challenges. Students will use the skills they have learned in other
      aspects of their undergraduate work to explore legal principles related to
      computing and the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how
      to apply them to issues raised by computers and technology. They will also
      learn substantive aspects of technology-related law, including the legal
      frameworks for free speech and intellectual property law.&nbsp;
      Additionally, students will earn how to communicate the results of their
      work effectively, both verbally and in writing, with an awareness of
      audience, purpose, and context. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is
        a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much of
        our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
        dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
        chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
        apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
        opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
        may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
        and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that you
        will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU
          are the most important component of this class, so please come
          prepared to think, discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At
          the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you
          disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>

        Requirements:&nbsp; </b>All Fall, 2024 CS 405 classes are being offered
      in-person, so we will not be offering any online synchronous class
      sessions.&nbsp; However, all students will have certain asynchronous
      requirements as well as many materials and assignments that will require
      BB access to complete. Accordingly, all students will need to be prepared
      for the following technology requirements to successfully complete this
      class:
      <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
        <ul>
          <li>a device and regular Internet access capable of regularly

    <p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> Computer Science majors do not always
      recognize the key role writing will play in their future professional
      careers. Although CS professionals working outside academia do not
      generally have discipline-specific writing in the conventional sense, CS
      majors are required to write on a regular basis in order to communicate
      with both technical and non-technical personnel, to explain their code and
      ideas, to justify their proposals, to persuade customers of the usefulness
      or quality of their products, and to collaborate in planning and building
      complex software. Thus, it is critical that CS majors learn to write
      clearly, to understand their audience, to explain complex ideas in
      language that can be understood by those with less technical expertise,
      and to write persuasively in order to convince others that their proposals
      are worthwhile, feasible, and ethical. In addition, CS majors often must
      create clear and organized instructional materials for those who use their
      systems.</p>
    <p>CS 405 is a Writing Intensive (WI) Course that, together with CS 321,
      meets the GMU WI Requirements for the BS CS and BS ACS programs.
      Accordingly, each student in CS 405 is required to write a minimum of 1750
      individual words, which will be graded and returned to the student with
      feedback. Students will also receive instruction on the writing process as
      part of class lectures and activities. Students will satisfy the following
      Writing Intensive Outcomes as part of the Writing Intensive Component of
      the course:</p>
    <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing-to-Learn</i>:</b> students will use
      informal or formal writing in ways that deepen their awareness of the
      field of study and its subject matter.&nbsp; <br>
      <b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing-to-Communicate</i>:</b> students will
      compose one or more written genres specific to the field of study in order
      to communicate key ideas tailored to specific audiences and purposes;
      genres may be academic, public, or professional.&nbsp; <br>
      <b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing-as-a-process</i>:</b> students will draft
      and revise written works based on feedback they receive from instructors
      and peers, using strategies appropriate to the genre, audience, and
      purpose. </p>
    <p> Students will conduct informal writing<b> [Writing to Learn] </b>for
      in-class Writing Workshops and other activities, discussion board posts,
      and peer exchanges. Students will complete at least two essay quizzes in
      class of at least 250 words each based on prior reading assignments in
      order to deepen their awareness of the the course subject matter and learn
      to communicate key ideas. <b>[Writing to Learn, Writing to Communicate]</b>
      To work on writing as a process, students will draft and revise one or
      more written works based on feedback received from instructors and peers.
      Writing assignments will include individual portions of the semester-long
      Mock Trial group project, at least one of which will be revised based on
      both instructor and peer feedback <b>[Writing as a Process, Writing to
        Communicate]</b>; and a formal essay of at least 1250 words related to
      law and ethics, including in-class writing that will be revised based on
      instructor feedback and tailored to a specific audience and purpose and
      submitted for a draft grade, then revised again based on additional
      feedback and submitted as a final version for a separate grade. <b>[Writing
        as a Process, Writing to Communicate]</b> Students will also work with
      partners to research and prepare substantial written materials in
      preparation for their&nbsp;Mock Trials. </p>
    <p><b>Grading Policy:</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Class Participation (incl. in-class activities,
      Writing Workshops, and short preparatory assignments) (15%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Brief quizzes on assigned reading and recent lecture
      material (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Essay quizzes based on assigned reading and recent
      lecture material (10%) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Non-trial Discussion Board assignments (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Formal Essay (1250 words: Essay Draft (5%) and Essay
      Final (10%)) (15% total)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Mock Trial Group Project and Presentation (30% total
      for trial + all pretrial assignments)<small><br>
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Final Exam (20%) <br>
        </big></small></p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work: &nbsp;You are expected to submit
      all work by the stated due date. &nbsp;</span>Late work may be accepted at
    the discretion of the instructor, but &nbsp;will be subject to a late
    penalty, typically 5-10% per day (incl. weekends).<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;The group project is divided into several parts, and no late
      work&nbsp;will be accepted after the due date for the next sequential
      part. &nbsp;NO late work of any kind will be accepted for credit after
      Monday, December 9, 2024. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Attendance:</span>&nbsp; You should assume ALL normally scheduled classes
    are synchronous and require attendance unless specifically told
    otherwise.&nbsp; Occasional classes may be asynchronous (not requiring class
    attendance), these will be clearly announced in advance (unless occurring
    due to unforeseen events, such as inclement weather).&nbsp; Students should
    plan to attend ALL class sessions prepared to participate and ready to
    discuss the readings assigned for that day.&nbsp; Failure to do so will be
    reflected in your class participation grade.&nbsp; (Students unable to
    attend class due to emergency or covid-19 quarantine should contact their
    instructor immediately to make special arrangements for any missed
    classes.)&nbsp; Group project grading may include a confidential review of
    participating group members by each student, and individual grades may be
    adjusted later in the semester if deemed appropriate based on repeated lack
    of participation or poor work quality as evidenced by either instructor
    observation or report by fellow group members. <b>If an assignment requires
