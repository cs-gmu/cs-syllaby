      <h3> CS 490 Design Exhibition</h3>
      <b>Spring 2019</b><br/>
        Fridays 1:30 am - 4:10  pm<br/>
        Innovation Hall 215G
        <br />
      

      <p><h4>Course Description:</h4>      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        This course provides computer science majors with an opportunity to work on a semester-long
        project or research paper that is more substantial than the projects or 
        papers assigned in other CS classes. To achieve this creative goal,
        students may work in teams or individually.
        CS faculty members can also serve as mentors of the project
        or research paper, and the effort will be coordinated by 
        the course instructor.  
        <p>
        Milestones throughout the semester must be met for successful completion of the course.
        These include submission of initial design specification documents, bi-weekly written 
        reports and oral presentations, development of assessment criteria to measure student success,
        final project/paper report with accompanying software artifacts, and a formal presentation 
        of the project/research paper at the end of the semester.
        <p>
        For BS CS students, this course can be used as both a CS-related and CS-Senior elective. 
        For ACS majors, this course can be used to satisfy the ACS CS 400-level course requirement for all concentrations.
        </p>

      <h4>Course Outcomes:      </h4>
      <blockquote>
        (1) Students will complete an original scholarly or creative project by: </br> </br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- articulating and refining a scholarly question by following ethical principles </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- choosing an appropriate discovery process for scholarly inquiry </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- gathering evidence appropriate to the question  </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- applying scholarly conventions appropriate to inquiry and reporting </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- assessing the vailidy of key assumptions and evidence </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and situating the inquiry within a broader context </br>
        <p>
        (2) Students will communicate knowledge from an original scholarly or creative project
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
            Please note that students will receive a final grade of C or better in this class

The course grade is based on three components:
         <blockquote>
         (1) Class participation: <b>20%</b> <br>
            <blockquote>Bi-weekly oral progress reports, demos and/or presentations; peer critiques; mandatory attendance.

         <p>
         (2) Deliverables:  <b>60%</b>
            <blockquote> 20% - Project design/research plan documents, including bi-weekly document updates (see Timetable)<br><p>
                       40% - A final project report that must include documented software
                       and/or project-generated artifacts (if a project is to be implemented.) For a research paper,
                       a final document must be submitted containing evidence of an original contribution that includes 
                       comparison to previous work in the literature.
            <p>
            </blockquote>
