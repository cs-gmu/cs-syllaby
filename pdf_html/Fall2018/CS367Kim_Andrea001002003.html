<p>
You must obtain a VSE labs account if you do not already have one,
so that you can write and run code on <code>zeus</code>. Grading occurs on this
system; other systems might be more forgiving for memory errors, and
you don't want to find that out with your grade!

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Active Learning Classrooms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
All three sections are in "active learning" classrooms. These have
movable chairs and/or desks, and more whiteboards on the walls.  Other
technology is available which we might use when appropriate as
well.
</p>

<p>
You should expect a more hands-on experience in this course - there
are many times where you simply need to practice, practice, practice:
doing binary calculations, drawing out memory, calculating physical
memory addresses, drawing out forking diagrams. By selecting these
classrooms, you will have a greater chance to master the skills this
course covers by practicing and participating.
</p>

<p>
You might need to change your mindset about what a classroom is, or
what attending a class will mean. Though we are not "flipping" the
classroom (there will still be lecture as opposed to solely assigned
videos/reading outside of class), we are aiming for a more interactive
experience. You need to bring pencils, whiteboard markers, and laptops
for the kinds of activities planned.
</p>

<p>
It's worth noting, too, that class time is when we hope to learn from
our unsuccessful attempts. Average class days are not test days -
getting something wrong is just proof you've identified a problem
worth your efforts. If you're not failing here and there, you're
probably not pushing yourself hard enough! By the time a test day
comes around, you should be so well practiced that there's no need to
cram for a test, because you've studied up all along.
</p>

<p>
<b>Student Responsibility:</b> It is your responsibility to be present, on
task, and supportive of each other. Whether you already understand a
concept and can reinforce that knowledge by trying to explain it to
others, or you gain understanding by working through examples, there
is always something for you to do in the course.

The course will have two tests and a final. Much of the work during
the semester will be completing projects, as well as regular
recitation activities (written and digital).

turning it in.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you should always be able to calculate your semester grade at any
point in the semester with the weightings above and the scale below.
</li>
<li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the end of
the semester; your grade should be a measure of your semester-long
progress.
</li>
<li>This is not a course that receives a magic, gigantic curve at the
end. Wherever your grade is headed, that is the outcome you should
expect after continued efforts.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all project grades averaged together evenly; there aren't many of them.
</li>
<li>they are due at a specific time on a specific day.
</li>
<li><b>no work is accepted 48 hours after the deadline</b> (even if you're
using late-day tokens!)
</li>
<li>late work incurs a 25% ceiling penalty each 24-hour period entered
after the deadline.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>example: one day of penalty would mean:
<pre class="example">
RecordedGrade = min(75, Raw_Score)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You begin the semster with three <b>One-Day-Late</b> tokens available
that each add 24 hours to the deadline of a project. These are
automatically applied to late work. Since no work is ever accepted
more than 48 hours after the official deadline, you can use at most
two tokens on a project.
</li>
<li>the final project might not be allowed to be turned in late at all,
to facilitate grading by the deadline.
</li>
<li>code that doesn't compile will likely get a very, very low
score. It specifically must compile on the <code>zeus</code> server.
</li>
<li><b>Turning it in on BlackBoard</b>: You can submit your work an
<i>unlimited number of times</i> to BlackBoard, and only the last
version (within 48 hours of the posted deadline) will be
graded. <b>tokens are automatically used based on submission
timestamps</b>. You can also download your submitted attempts, and
verify that you turned in a working copy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero.
</li>
<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
takes. Just don't put it in a public git repository where others
can find it (this has happened before).  Every semester multiple
students' computers die, are stolen, or otherwise 'lose' programs
and digital work. Don't be the student who forgot to (frequently)
back up your work!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of
your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must
ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</p>

<p>
We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply
will not be tolerated.
</p>

<p>
As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from
a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to compare
your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use
automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by
hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of
Academic Integrity.  Repeat to yourself: <b>it's not worth trying to
cheat.</b> We will catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.
</p>

<p>
The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade,
to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. The usual recommendation
is failure in the course.  It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a
semester and lose some implicated friends; please don't put yourself
through that experience!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented
with GMU's Office of Disability Services) that may impact academic
performance should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
appropriate accommodations. We are quite happy to assist as is
appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time by
ODS. Bringing the paperwork with you to a scheduled exam is far too
late! Even if you don't know if you plan on utilizing the
accommodations ahead of time, it's in your best interest to prepare
them ahead of time.
