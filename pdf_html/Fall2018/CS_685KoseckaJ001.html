<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The course 
  covers basic principles of design and practice of intelligent
  robotics systems. We will cover algorithms for the analysis of the
  data obtained by vision and range sensors, basic principles of
  modelling kinematics and dynamics and design of basic control
  strategies.
  
  Issues of uncertainty modelling, state estimation, probabilistic
  inference will be introduced and examined in the context of
  localization and map making problems.

  The last part of the course covers the basics and some examples of
  learning approaches where robotic agents can learn how to achieve
  complex goals in reinforcement learning framework. </font> </p>
 
  <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
  The topics and techniques covered are relevant 
  for students interested in robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence.
  The course will comprise of lectures by
  the instructor, homeworks and presentations of the selected research 
  publications by students. The grade will be based on homeworks and  
  final presentation of the project. The projects will involve 
  implementation of a systems in a robot simulator and/or the actual 
  (mobile) robot.</font>  </p>

      <b> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Academic Integrity: </b> <br> <br>
      
    <dd>
      The integrity of the University community is affected by the
      individual choices made by each of us. GMU has an Honor Code
      with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three
      fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times
      are that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the
      work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full
      credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain
      about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for
      clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic
      misconduct. Plagiarism means using the exact words, opinions, or
      factual information from another person without giving the
      person credit. Writers give credit through accepted
      documentation styles, such as parenthetical citation, footnotes,
      or endnotes. Paraphrased material must also be cited, using MLA
      or APA format. A simple listing of books or articles is not
      sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery
      and cannot be tolerated in the academic setting. If you have any
      doubts about what constitutes plagiarism, please see me. <br> <br>
