the semester will be completing projects, as well as regular
assessments in lab (exercises, quizzes, and programming tasks).
</p>

<p>
In general, all grades should be available about one week after the
deadline. We will often have Sunday project deadlines (plus 48 hours
of late work accepted), so you would usually get a grade posted by the
following week's Wednesday.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
<b>Each programming assignment is an individual effort; no collaboration allowed on projects.</b>
</p>

<p>
Programming projects will be a primary focus of your experience,
progress, and grade - each one should take multiple sessions of
coding, with questions asked of the course instructors in person or
online in between those sessions. This is the practice you need to
learn, master, and internalize various concepts of the course.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> Deadlines, Tokens</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each project has a posted deadline.
</li>
<li>The latest you can turn in work is 48 hours after the posted
deadline. There are no exceptions to this limit.
</li>
<li>each student gets three <b>One-Late-Day</b> tokens, which are
automatically used by submissions that are between 0-48 hours late
to avoid the points penalty associated with that day of lateness.
You still must turn in work within 48 hours of the original
deadline, even if you use tokens! (that means you can't use all
three tokens on a single project - pace yourself!)
</li>
<li>each day late (or portion thereof), when not covered by a token,
lowers the highest possible score by 25%. <code>recorded_grade =
   min(raw_score, 100-25*num_days_late)</code>
</li>
<li>the last project might not be allowed to be turned in late, to
facilitate end-of-semester grading.
</li>
<li>tokens are automatically applied to projects based on submission
timestamp. You can use tokens on labs if you manually request it,
but be advised they are far more valuable for projects or keeping
until semester's end.
</li>
<li>unused late-tokens will be worth a small bounty at the semester's
end (0.25% of the semester grade).

<h4 id="sec-2-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> Broken Code == Bad Scores</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
After the first two projects, any code turned in that does not run
(immediately crashes due to errors), specifically on Python 3.6 or
greater, will receive at most 50%. At this point, if the grader is
able to quickly fix your code, you might get some points back. If the
grader cannot immediately spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate
to get any points at all.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Turning in code that runs is a big deal!</i>

<h4 id="sec-2-2-3"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.3</span> Turning it in on BlackBoard</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">
<p>
You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
and by default only the last submission before the 48-hour limit
deadline will be graded. You can also download your submitted
attempts, and verify that you turned in a working copy.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turning in the wrong files (including empty or partial-work copies)
will likely result in a zero. Don't lose your one project-drop this
way!
</li>
<li>There is a difference between choosing to "save" your submission,
meaning you'll come back and finish turning in your work, and
choosing to "submit" your work, meaning actually sending the files
to the instructors at a specific timestamp as a submission. If
you've saved but not submitted, you haven't turned in your work
yet!
</li>
<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
extension. <b>Use a backup service</b> such as DropBox (or any cloud
service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
takes. Every semester multiple students have their computers die,
have computers stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the
student who forgot to (frequently) back up your work - it'll cost
tokens and a rushed re-implementation! There are computer labs on
campus where you can write and run python code if you have any
temporary machine issues.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All lab assessment grades will be averaged together evenly. Lab
assessments will be weekly exercises, tasks, or quizzes. Time in
lab will often be available to seek assistance on projects when
you've completed the lab task.
</li>

<li><b>Lab Exercises are open to all collaboration, but Lab Quizzes and Lab Tasks are entirely individual efforts; no resources may be used on them.</b>
</li>

<li>We will <b>drop the lowest two grades</b> from this category.
</li>

<li>Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the
reason why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major
award, getting married, saving the universe, etc.). This is the
reason you get lab drops! We don't consider further makeups.
</li>

<li>labs may only be turned in late by spending tokens; be advised that
tokens are far more valuable on projects. If you are out of tokens,
you can't turn in a late lab.
</li>

<li>If you choose to miss some labs early on, and later on have to miss for
some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save the drops
so you can actually throw out a bad grade, and not just hide a lazy
zero. Pretending you don't have them is your best approach.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>As a requirement for passing this course, students must have a passing grade on either (a) the weighted average of all tests/exams or (b) on a cumulative final exam. The university defines "passing" as earning a grade of D or higher.</b>
Students who meet this requirement will earn the grade indicated by
the weightings listed in this document; those who do not will fail
the course.
</li>
<li>these tests will focus on performing programming, on paper.
</li>
<li>all students must have their <b>GMU identification</b> available on
testing days.
</li>
<li>the final exam is cumulative. If you perform better on the final
exam than a previous test, we will replace the test grade with the
final grade.
</li>
<li>if you miss the final, there is nothing we can do for you. <b>Don't miss the final!</b>
</li>

<li>the final will not be given early. You are starting the course with
knowledge of the schedule. Plan on being in Fairfax for the entire
exam period, as weather can cause unexpected delays in the
examination schedule.
</li>

<li>there will only be a curve if specific questions end up being too
ambiguous or otherwise obviously unfair - we don't target some
mythical bell curve; everyone can do very well!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
grader. For all projects and lab work, that is either your GTA who
leads the lab section, or a different GTA who signed their name on
the grading comments under rare circumstances. For the tests and
final exam, that is your professor.
</li>

<li>If you have not initiated contact within a week of a grade being
posted to BlackBoard, you accept the grade by default. We cannot
entertain a swarm of contested grades at the eleventh hour to try
to maximize end-of-semester grades. Keep up with your grades
throughout the semester.
</li>

<li>We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often
through specific test cases, automated as part of the grading
process. All GTAs coordinate together with a shared scoring
breakdown and regularly communicate with each other before, during,
and after the grading process to keep it fair and consistent.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The Honor Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure
of your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we
must ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</li>

<li>The CS department doesn't have any "extra" policy for the honor
code on top of the university's. The documents shared below help
you to understand how it applies to programming and CS but they
don't actually restrict it at all.
</li>

<li>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code
simply will not be tolerated. <b>This includes using code found on
the internet</b>.
</li>

<li>There are definitely opportunities to study, work, and learn
together throughout this course - Zyante questions, lab exercises,
and more. Mostly you will need to work independently for any sort
of "test" (lab quizzes, lab tasks, tests, final exam) and for
projects.
</li>

<li>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work
from a friend, or even to just work on the project on your own
machines next to each other, remember that it is just as easy to
compare your work automatically and electronically, and discover
the similarities in text and structure. We use automated software
to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to find the
cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity.
Repeat to yourself: <b>it's not worth trying to cheat.</b> We will catch
it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.
</li>

<li>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero
grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases
of cheating almost always translate into course failure.
</li>

<li>discussing any individually assigned work with anyone other than a
course instructor, UTA, or GTA is explicitly forbidden, regardless
of medium (in person, online, through "chat" features, etc).

<li>All students will abide by <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/">GMU's Honor Code</a>.

every other involved student must be turned in to the honor court.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented
with GMU's Office of Disability Services) that may impact academic
performance should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
appropriate accommodations. We are quite happy to assist as is
appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time. Bringing the
accommodation paperwork with you to a scheduled assessment is far
too late! Even if you don't know if you plan on utilizing the
accommodations ahead of time, it's in your best interest to prepare
ahead of time.
