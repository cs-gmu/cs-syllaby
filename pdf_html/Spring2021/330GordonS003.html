  <h2 class="title">Course Overview</h2>
  
  <h3>Course Description</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
	CS211 and Math 125 (C or better in both).</p>

    <p><em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
	This course is an introduction to two kinds of formal systems -
	languages (which are treated as sets of strings) and logics -
	with important applications to computer
	science. The study of formal languages underlies important aspects of
	compilers and other language processing systems, as well as the theory
	of computation. Various systems of logic and automatic reasoning are
	put to use in artificial intelligence, database theory and software
	engineering. The entire course will give you practice in precise
	thinking and proof methods that play a role in the analysis of
	algorithms.</p>
<!-- The programming assignments provide practical experience with --
  -- some theoretical topics.   </p> -->
      
    <p> <em><strong>Objectives and Outcomes</strong></em><br>
	Will understand the concepts and relevance of logic, formal
	languages and
	automata theory, and computability.<br>
	  Will be able to able to do mechanical formal proofs, 
	  prove program correctness for simple programs, and solve
	  problems in
	  first-order logic.<br>
	  Will be able to solve problems in elementary machine models:
	  designing
	  finite-state automata, pushdown automata and Turing machines.<br>
	      Will be able to solve problems in formal languages:
	      writing regular
	      expressions, regular grammars, and context-free grammars. </p>

    <p> <em><strong>Textbook</strong></em><br>	    
	Title: Logic and Languages Models for Computer Science, 3rd edition.<br>
	  Authors: Dana Richards and Henry Hamberger <br>
	    Available at the campus bookstore<br> <b>Note</b> that the 3rd
	      edition is substantially different from the 2nd.</p>

	       <h3> Logistics </h3>
    <blockquote>
       <p><em><strong>Zoom Meetings</strong></em><br>
      The lectures and all office hours will meet virtually, using
      Zoom.  I do not intend to be in my office this semester.  You will need to
      <a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYrcu2uqToiHtRy-ikDCp7uS5sOfC0BJoaO">register</a>
      one time (only) before you can attend a lecture.  You can
      find the meeting link through Blackboard: click on Tools, then
      Zoom.  The meeting ID is <a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/j/92654671840">926 5467 1840</a>.    If we ever have problems
      with Zoom, we will move to Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.   The
      same holds for Office hours, but it is a separate meeting ID.
      Register once
      for <a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0lceisrj0uEtXsk-kNCVro_dsb2I9yL4MR">Monday</a>
      office hours (<a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/j/99861406481">998 6140 6481</a>), and once for <a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0tfuuhqjMjHdEUeA2HfoZDepengv--pZEb">Tuesday</a>
      office hours (<a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/j/99092948975">990 9294 8975</a>). 

      
      	 </p>

       <p><em><strong>Webcams</strong></em><br>
	   I will not insist on the use of cameras during class time, but
	   I <b>strongly</b> encourage it. The  more people that use
	   them, the more engaging the experience will be for us all.
	   Cameras are turned on by default as you join the meetings.

	   <p><em><strong>Piazza</strong></em><br>
	       I will answer all questions on piazza, rather than by
	       email.  I realize that some posts need to be private,
	       but when in doubt, I encourage you to <b>make your
	       posts public!</b>  Everyone will benefit from your
	       questions, and I prefer that we all learn from them.
	       Generally, I'm not that worried about questions that
	       give hints.  (Within reason.)   Please note: piazza is
	       changing their business model.  If they ask you for
	       money, you should feel no obligation to provide that. 
	       
	   
	   <p><em><strong>Gradescope</strong></em><br>
	       Quizzes, homeworks and
	       exams will all be submitted through Gradescope.
	       You can find gradescope through Blackboard:
	       click on Tools, then gradescope.  You should also be
	       able to access it directly from the gradescope website,
	       if you use your GMU login.   When submitting an
	       assignment, <b>please</b> mark each question with the
	       appropriate question number, as this makes grading much
	       easier.


	   <p><em><strong>Overleaf</strong></em><br>
	       I will release the assignments on overleaf. This is a
	       web-based platform for writing latex documents.  You do
	       not need special software, and I will not insist that
	       you use latex to write your answers.  You can simply
	       view the PDF from the webpage, and submit answers to
	       Gradescope in whatever format you like.  However,
	       I <b>encourage</b> you to use latex - it is fairly
	       easy, and produces nice PDFs.  To do that, just copy
	       the project that I've shared, and edit.
	       </blockquote>
	   
  <h2 class="title">Course Requirements</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em><strong>Grading</strong></em><br>
	  Quizzes -- 10% <br>
	  Homeworks -- 30% <br>
	  <!-- Programming assignment -- 20% <br> -->
	  Exams -- 60% <br>
	Of these exams the highest score will count 35%, and the lowest 25%.  </p>

      <p> <em><strong>Homework</strong></em><br>

	  Homework will be assigned each week.  The two lowest homework
	  grades will be dropped.   <br>  <u>Suggestions:</u>  It will be very hard to do well
	  in this course if you do not do all of the homework by yourself,
	  including any optional problems.
	  You are strongly encouraged to
	  do <em>all</em> of the problems, and to ask questions, in
	  class and in office hours, when you do not
	  understand any of them.  Don't start the homework the day
	  before it is due! </p>

      <p> <em><strong>Quizzes</strong></em><br>
	  Quizzes are short: 1-3 questions, multiple choice or
	  fill-in-the-blank.  You will need a laptop or phone to
	  answer the questions, as the results will be tallied immediately.
	  Each single quiz is worth < 1% of your
          grade.  They will be given at the start of class (don't be
	  late!), typically every other
	  class period.  They will cover the previous 1 or 2 lectures,
	  and mainly serve to help me gauge what the students have
	  understood, and what needs further explanation. </p>

<!---      <p> <em><strong>Programming Assignments</strong></em><br>

There will be a programming assignment in Prolog. Collaboration on
this assignment is NOT allowed.  Receiving direct contributions to the
code and submitting them is considered a violation of the Honor
Code. (See <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">here</a> for the GMU and Computer Science guidelines.)
Programs will be marked down 25% each class they are late; in
particular, they are marked down 25% after the due date. </p> -->

<p> <em><strong>Exams</strong></em><br>
All testing is closed book, and notes are not permitted. 
The two exams, including the final, each cover about a half of the
semester.  The final is not cumulative. <br>
      The midterm is Wednesday, March 3rd, in class.  <br>  The final is Wednesday, 5/5,
	1:30-4:15pm. 
.</p>

      <p> <em><strong>CS330 Adviser Forms</strong></em><br>
It is a departmental requirement that students in CS330 must see their
adviser and discuss their degree progress.  The form can be downloaded
<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/student-forms/">here.</a>  Be
sure to fill out the form <b>before</b> seeing your adviser, if you
are meeting virtually.  This semester, I believe it is also OK to
communicate by email.  Note, if
you do it <b>earlier</b> in the semester, you will be more likely to
connect with your adviser, and you will have more time to correct any
problems.  If you wait until the last week, your adviser might not be
available.  Students not fulfilling
this requirement will receive an Incomplete grade. (Non-majors are not included.)   <br><br>
