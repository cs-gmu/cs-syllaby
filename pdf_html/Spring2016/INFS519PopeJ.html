	<h3>TEXTBOOKS</h3>
	<p>Mark Allen Weiss, Data Structures & Problem Solving Using Java, 4th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2010.</p>
    <p>Algorithms, 4th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2011. (Supplemental/Optional)</p>

	<h3>SOFTWARE & PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<p>You will need a computer for this class running some modern operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember that lab computers are also available on campus, see next section</p>
	<p>The prerequisite for this course is SWE 510 or its equivalent. I will assume a "semester's worth" of programming experience in Java. You should understand basic programming in Java including program design, coding, and debugging techniques.</p>

	<h3>CAMPUS RESOURCES</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Computer Labs - there are several freely available computer labs on campus, for hours and locations please see: <a href="http://doit.gmu.edu/staffSection.asp?page=lab">http://doit.gmu.edu/staffSection.asp?page=lab</a></li>
		<li>Office of Disability Services - <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a></li>

	<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h3>
	<p>Both the University and the Computer Science Department have honor codes you are expected to adhere to. We will be reviewing these in class, but more information about the university honor code can be found here: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/</a> and the deparment's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>. You are bound by these honor codes.</p>
	<p>Any submitted work which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors Committee. Any code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the project may be included in your programs.</p>

		<li>Dynamic lists</li>
		<li>Linked lists</li>
		<li>Stacks and queues</li>
		<li>Trees</li>
		<li>Graphs</li>
		<li>Generics</li>
		<li>Recursion</li>

	<h3>GRADED ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
	<p><i>Programming Projects</i></p>
	<p>These will be announced online and in class and due 1 week from the announcement. Assignments should be turned in no later than midnight on the day they are due (GMU-time). The topics covered in each project will reflect one or more of the topics we are covering in class and/or the reading assignments.</p>

	<h3>SPECIAL POLICIES</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Laptops and Other Electronic Devices - will be allowed in class only at certain times.</li>
		<li>Attendance - is not required, but is strongly recommended.</li>
		<li>Group Work - is ok for reading and studying, but is not ok for: homework assignments, programming assignments, or exams.</li>
		<li>Late Assignments -  will not be accepted without prior approval.</li>
		<li>Makeup Exams - require exceptional circumstances (as judged by me) and must be arranged in advance.</li>
	</ul>
