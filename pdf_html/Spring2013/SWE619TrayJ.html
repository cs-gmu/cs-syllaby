<h3>
Course Description</h3>
To give the students a solid understanding of modern software construction.
To prepare students to construct sequential and concurrent programs. To
encourage the construction of software systems of high quality. In-depth
study of software construction in a modern language including control structuring
and packaging. Concepts such as information hiding, data abstraction, and
object-based and object-oriented software construction are discussed and
illustrated. This course is part of the core of the SWE program and utilizes
the Java programming language.

<li>
Some assignments may require programming techniques not
covered in the two required texts.
I will provide pointers to online material
at the appropriate time.
<b>Required</b>.
</li>

<li>
Any Java reference, either text or online. <b>Recommended</b>.
Online Java documenation is available from
<td><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html">Oracle</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Assignments
</h3>
Submit assignments that are Java programs electronically 
via <a href="http://mymasonportal.gmu.edu" Target = "_blank">Blackboard</a>.

<p><b>Note:</b> Homework is due exactly at the start of class on the due date.  
Paper and pencil homework can be brought directly to class.
Or, you can submit an electronic version via Blackboard.

<p><b>Important:  </b>For programs, please submit a <b>paper</b> copy as well
as the electronic version.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because of the way
the University runs it printing services. Thank you for your support.

<p>
Details about specific requirements for each assignment
are given with each assignment.

<p>
Early homework assignments focus on theortical aspects from Liskov.
Later homework assignments reinforce specific programming techniques,
as well as the design points made in Bloch.
Each homework assignment is designed to be fairly short,
and homework is due on a weekly basis.
<P>

<h3>
Quizzes
</h3>

Each class, except for the first class, begins with a short quiz.
Each quiz covers material from the previous session(s).

<p>
The goal of the quizzes is to keep students abreast of the material
covered in class. Because of the quizzes, there is no midterm exam.

<h3>
Missed Homework and Quizzes
</h3>
In recognition of the fact that many students have occasional but 
unavoidable commitments that preclude attendance at every class, 
I drop each student's lowest homework score and 
2 lowest quiz scores prior to final grade computations.

<p>
<b>Late homework will receive a maximum of 50% credit.</b>

<p>
<b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>
Please do not ask for an exception. 

<h3>
Final Exam</h3>
A final exam is held during the University-scheduled exam period.
No make-up test will be given for the final examination.
<h3>
Honor System:</h3>
Students are reminded that the honor system governs all work turned in
for credit. Each assignment must be worked on <b>individually</b>. A submission
carries with it an implicit statement that the submission is your own work.
You may discuss the requirements and syntactical issues, but not solutions
or designs. Collaboration is not allowed on the quizzes or on the final.
I will refer violators to the GMU Honor Committee according
to the procedures given in the GMU Course Catalog.
Further details available at the
<a href ="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
CS Department's Honor Code</a>
page.
<h3>
Grading</h3>
Grades are computed as: Assignments (30%), Quizzes (30%), Final (40%).
<h3>
Updates
</h3>
As the semester progresses, I post notices about changes
to the course 
<A href="./619/update.html">updates page</A>.
