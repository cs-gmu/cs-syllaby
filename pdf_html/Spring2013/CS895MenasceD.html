<p><a NAME="DESCRIPTION"></a><i>DESCRIPTION :</i>
<p>CS 895 is a 3-credit doctoral seminar that studies a very hot area in Computer Science called
<i>autonomic computing</i>. These systems have the property of being self-managing, self-optimizing,
self-configuring, self-tuning, self-healing, and self-protecting.
For this reason, autonomic systems are also known as <i>self-*</i> systems.
The main motivations for autonomic systems include the ever increasing complexity of modern computer systems 
(e.g., e-commerce systems, systems based on Web Services, Service-Oriented Architectures, Grid Computing, Cloud Computing) 
and the highly unpredictable demands on these systems. These factors make it difficult, and sometimes 
impossible, for human beings to constantly reconfigure the systems to adapt to varying load and 
occurrence of failures or security attacks.
Therefore, systems have to be able to adapt themselves as the human body adapts itself to various
sorts of external  conditions.  
<p>
This course addresses many types of autonomic systems as well as various techniques to design and
build such systems. This is a doctoral seminar based on reading and analysis of current papers.
Master students are allowed to take the course based on instructor permission.

<p><a NAME="GRADING POLICY"></a><i>GRADING POLICY:</i>
<p>Grades are based on class participation, presentation of papers in class, and on two term papers.
Grades will be numerical on the scale 0-100. Your final numerical grade,
G, is computed as:
<br>
G = 0.15* Class Participation + 0.20 * Paper Presentations in Class + 0.25 * Term Paper 1 + 0.4 * Term Paper 2

<p>The following table is used to convert your numerical grade G to a letter grade:<p>

<p>There is no curving. No extra credit assignments will be given after the
semester is over to increase grades. The instructor may decide to give
an extra-credit assignment during the semester. Everyone will be given
the opportunity to do the extra-credit assignment.

<p><a NAME="SYLLABUS"></a><i>SYLLABUS:</i>
Week 1 will be devoted to an introduction to the topic and to course logistics.
Each week thereafter will be devoted to the the analysis and discussion of papers.
Papers will be assigned in advance and two or three  students will be selected to be the
primary presenters of the paper to the class.


<br>Students assigned to papers have to prepare a power point presentation about the paper. The first 
slide has to contain the name of the paper, its full citation (authors and were it appeared), and the phrase
"Summarized by <student name>".


 Discussion will follow each presentation. Students have to
come prepared to discuss the papers in class. All  students will be required to bring 
a one-page summary/critique of the papers read each week. This will count toward class participation.
<p><a NAME="READINGS"></a><i>READINGS:</i>
<p>Papers will be selected from various sources including:
<ol>
<li>
Proceedings of the 2005 through 2012 <a href="http://www.autonomic-conference.org/">IEEE Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC)</a>
<li> Papers from the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/pub.cfm?id=J1010">ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS)</a>
<li>
Proceedings of the <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/icas/index.html">Autonomous and Autonomic Systems (ICAS) Conference</a>
<li>Papers in <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~menasce/autonomic/">Menasce's autonomic web site</a>
</ol>
Other recommended books:
<ol>
<li>
Self-Star Properties in Complex Information Systems, O. Babaoglu, M. Jelasity, A. Montresor, C. Fetzer , S. Leonardi, A. van Moorsel, and M. van Steen, eds., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 3460, Springer Verlag, 2005.

<p>
<hr><a NAME="TERM-PAPERS"></a><i>TERM PAPERS:</i>
<p>For each term paper, students will select a coherent set of a minimum of 4 to 5 papers, the core papers,
 on which they
will base the term paper. The term paper has to cover at least the following topics:
a) general area of the issue addressed within autonomic computing; b) summary of the contributions
presented in the core papers.  This summary must be written in your own words in a way that clearly
lays out the assumptions and limitations of each contribution; c) critique of the papers; and
d) open problems and future work that could be derived from the work presented in the core papers.
Grading will be based on content, organization, and readibility.
It is expected that the second term paper has some novel material that, if worked up some more, could lead to the submission
of a conference paper.

<p>
Students will present to the class their second term paper on the last day of classes.
