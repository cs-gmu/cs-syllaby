<h2>Course Description:</h2>
GMU catalog: This course is an in-depth introduction to the theory and practice of Network Security. It assumes basic knowledge of cryptography and its applications in modern network protocols. The course studies firewalls architectures and virtual private networks and provides deep coverage of widely used network security protocols such as SSL, TLS, SSH, Kerberos, IPSec, IKE, and LDAP. It covers countermeasures to distributed denial of service attacks, security of routing protocols and the Domain Name System, Email security and spam countermeasures, wireless security, multicast security and trust negotiation.
<p>
This course will present current attacks and and defenses against networked computers. As a growing number of everyday things not typically thought as computer gain computational ability and in turn are connected to networks traditional security methods, such as locks and physical security mechanisms are no longer sufficient to protect them. This course will delve into the concepts and tools defenders have at their disposal and which threats they can mitigate.
