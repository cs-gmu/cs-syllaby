<p>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY<br>
  Mason is an Honor Code university; please see the University Catalog for a full<br>
  description of the code and the honor committee process. The principle of academic<br>
  integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely. What does academic<br>
  integrity mean in this course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you<br>
  will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&rsquo;s work in an aspect of the<br>
  performance of that task, you will give full credit in the proper, accepted form. Another<br>
  aspect of academic integrity is the free play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are<br>
  encouraged in this course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be<br>
  conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When<br>
  in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.<br>
