      <span class="section">Description</span></p><p>
      This course is an introduction to two kinds of formal systems - 
      languages and logics - with important applications to computer science. 
      The study of formal languages underlies important aspects of compilers
      and other language processing systems, as well as the theory of 
      computation. Various systems of logic and automatic reasoning are put 
      to use in artificial intelligence, database theory and software 
      engineering. The entire course will give you practice in precise 
      thinking and proof methods that play a role in the analysis of 
      algorithms. The programming assignments provide practical experience 
      with some theoretical topics.</p><p> 

      <span class="section">Outcomes</span></p><p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>
            Students will understand the concepts and relevance of logic, 
            formal languages and automata theory, and computability.
        </li>
        <li>
            Students will be able to do mechanical formal proofs, program

        <li>
            Students will be able to solve problems in formal languages:

        <li>
            it is a departmental requirement that all undergraduate Computer 
            Science students taking CS330 <span class="emph">must speak with their 
            advisor</span> during the semester and submit 
            <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/media/uploads/programs/undergraduate/cs/advisorchecklist.pdf">
            documentation</a> of their visit; failure to do so will result in 
            an Incomplete grade (either a signed copy of the form or an emailed confirmation from the 
			advisor must be sent to both myself and to the department, at 
			<a href="mailto:csug@gmu.edu">csug@gmu.edu</a>).
        </li>
		<li>
		    Campus closure due to inclement weather will not affect this course, as the course is fully

		<li>
		    Inclement weather (power outages) may still impact student participation in the course.  Recordings
			of the course will be available, in the event that a student cannot participate due to power/Internet 
			outage.  If a power outage occurs during a quiz/exam, note the time of the outage and contact the 
			instructor as soon as possible.  If the lecture itself is disrupted due to power outage and unable to resume,
			announcements will be posted to Piazza and the lecture may be supplemented by pre-recorded videos.
