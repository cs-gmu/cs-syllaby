  <h2 class="title">Course Overview</h2>
  <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
      The course will provide an introduction to modern cryptography.
      We will cover many practical topics, such as how to correctly
      use block ciphers and hash functions for the most common tasks:
      encryption and message authentication, the differences
      between public key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography,
      and a few ways to build public key encryption and signatures.
      We will learn about how to properly define security, and how to
      prove that our constructions are secure.  In addition, with what
      time we remains, we will cover several recent topics in
      cryptography, such as the use of block chains for crypto
      currencies, and securely computing on private data. </p>
      
    <p> <em><strong>Objectives</strong></em><br>
      The main objectives are to convey the importance
      of <em>provable</em> security, to teach students how to use
      cryptographic tools in a way that is provably secure, to
      provide students with the ability to decide whether a
      protocol is secure, and to demonstrate the range of what can be
      achieved with provable security.  </p>

    <p> <em><strong>Course Outcomes</strong></em><br>
	Students taking this class will: (a) be able to understand the
	security properties achieved by common cryptographic
	mechanisms such as encryption or digital signatures, (b) be
	familiar with a number of cryptographic primitives
	available to solve a variety of problems, (c) gain
	some experience with how these cryptographic tools can be used to secure
	modern systems.   
      
    <p> <em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
      There are no formal prerequisites for this course, and I intend
      for everything to be self-contained. However,
      students should have some level of mathematical
      maturity. Accordingly, a
      course such as CS330 would be a good course to take prior to
      this one.  Students should be comfortable writing proofs, and
      should have comfort with basic probability theory.   </p>

    </blockquote>
    <h3> Logistics </h3>
    <blockquote>
       <p><em><strong>Meetings</strong></em><br>
      The course will meet virtually, using Zoom.  You will need to
      <a href="https://gmu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMpdOuurTItEt2KRuC93MxFXAE03Ic_qOVs">register</a>
      one time before you can attend any of the meetings.  You can
      find the meeting link through Blackboard: click on Tools, then
      Zoom.  The
      password for every meeting will be the same, and will be
      posted on the course piazza board.   If we ever have problems
      with Zoom, we will move to Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.
      Office hours will be held the same way as class meetings.  I do
      not intend to be in my office this semester.   
	 </p>

       <p><em><strong>Webcams</strong></em><br>
	   I will not insist on the use of cameras during class time, but
	   I <b>strongly</b> encourage it. The  more people that use
	   them, the more engaging the experience will be for us all.
	   Cameras are turned on by default as you join the meetings.
	   
	   
       <p><em><strong>Lecture Videos</strong></em><br>
	   Students are expected to watch videos each week, prior to
	   the class meeting time.  In the meeting, I will review
	   questions about those videos, and we will work through
	   related problems.  Links to the videos can be found in the 	<a href="https://www.cs.gmu.edu/~gordon/teaching/crypto_2020/syllabus.html#schedule">
	 class schedule.</a> </p>

       <p><em><strong>Class Announcements and Discussion</strong></em><br>
	   All class announcements will be made through piazza.
	   Please make sure you are registered for this course in
	   piazza before the first day of class.  Students are also
	   encouraged to post questions about homework, course
	   videos there, and logistics there.  
	 </p>

  <h2 class="title">Course Requirements</h2>

  <h3>Homework</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There will be 10 homework assignments. Homework will be due
    at class time on Wednesdays.
    Students are welcome to work in groups, but <em>every student
    must write their solutions independently.</em>  Homework that
    appear overly similar will be considered to violate the honor
    code. 
    <p>I encourage students to type their answers, both because they
    will be easier to read, and also because I believe it helps you clarify your
    own thinking.  You can use
    this <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/ftqxrpjvqsjv">LaTex
    template file</a>, if it is helpful to you.  Please post on
    piazza if you have trouble. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     There will be one midterm and one final exam. Students will have
     1 class period to finish the midterm exam (see schedule below),
     but then can repeatedly resubmit the midterm to improve their
     grade. <b> Midterms must be submitted by 7:10 pm on 10/9.</b>
     Midterm re-submissions are due 3 weeks after the original, graded
     submissions are returned to the students. 
     Students are strongly encouraged to use
     Overleaf for midterm re-submissions, as this will make it easier to provide
     feedback.  The final exam will be cumulative, and students will
     have 1 week to complete the exam.  The final 
     cannot be re-submitted for feedback.   </p>
    </blockquote>
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     Quizzes are short: 1-2 questions, multiple choice or
     fill-in-the-blank. They will be administered through Blackboard /
    Gradescope.    Each
     single quiz is worth < 1% of your grade. They will be given at
     the start of class (don't be late!), and will cover
     the videos that were intended to be watched at home over the
     previous week.  They mainly 
     serve to help me gauge what the students have understood, and
     what needs further explanation.  </p>
    </blockquote>

<h3>CS 587</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Students in CS 587 will be be given extra homework problems on
    most homeworks, and an extra problem on each of the exams.  They
      will also have to read Chapter 7 independently.</p>
    </blockquote>

    
  <h3>Grading</h3>
  <blockquote>
    	  Quizzes -- 10%.  The lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. <br>
	  Homeworks -- 30%.  The lowest two homework
	  grades will be dropped. <br>  
	  <!-- Programming assignment -- 20% <br> -->
	  Midterm Exam -- 35%. <br>
	    Final Exam --  25%. <br> </p>
	  </blockquote>
