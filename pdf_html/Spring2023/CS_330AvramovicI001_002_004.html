      <span class="section">Description</span></p><p>
      This course is an introduction to two kinds of formal systems - 
      languages and logics - with important applications to computer science. 
      The study of formal languages underlies important aspects of compilers
      and other language processing systems, as well as the theory of 
      computation. Various systems of logic and automatic reasoning are put 
      to use in artificial intelligence, database theory and software 
      engineering. The entire course will give you practice in precise 
      thinking and proof methods that play a role in the analysis of 
      algorithms. The programming assignments provide practical experience 
      with some theoretical topics.</p><p> 

      <span class="section">Outcomes</span></p><p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>

      <span class="section">Advising Requirement</span><p>
            It is a departmental requirement that all undergraduate Computer 
            Science students taking CS330 <span class="emph">must speak with their 
            faculty advisor</span> during the semester and submit an advising form 
			(<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/media/uploads/programs/undergraduate/cs/advisorchecklist.pdf">found here</a>) documenting their visit.
          <ul>
		    <li>Upload your completed and signed form to Blackboard; scan if necessary.</li>
		    <li><b>Failure to complete the advising requirement will result in an Incomplete grade in CS 330.</b></li>
			<li>Your <i>faculty advisor</i> is a professor who has been assigned to you, not the CS departmental advising staff; look for an email from the department informing you who your faculty advisor is.
			<li>Non CS-majors and graduate students are exempt from the advising requirement.</li>
			<li>Students who are taking CS110 and CS330 during the same semester only need to complete one form.</li>
            <li>Please complete the advising requirement <b>before the midterm date</b>; your advisor may be busy and unable to meet towards the end of the semester.</li>
            <li><b>What is the goal of the advising requirement?</b><ul>
                <li>To motivate you to plan ahead when choosing classes.
				<li>To encourage you to take the opportunity to ask a faculty member any questions you may have about your academic plans.
				<li>To check that there are no circumstances that you might have overlooked which might hinder your academic progress.
				<li>To advise you of things to consider if you are contemplating graduate school.</li>
            </ul>				
		  </ul>

      Honor Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Department Honor Code</a>, and will typically result in failing the class.</p><p>
	  
	  Some kinds of participation in third-party online study sites violate the GMU Honor code: these include accessing questions for this class which have been uploaded by others; accessing exam or assignment answers for this class; uploading of any of the instructor's materials or exams; and uploading any of your own answers or finished work.  It is <b>your resposibility</b> to protect your work, including protecting your computer with a password and avoiding sites which make your work publicly visible. Always consult with the professor before using these sites.</p><p>
	  
	  Please respect the importance of upholding the Honor Code, since it affects the meaningfulness of your degree and the degrees of other students. As a practical matter, an understanding of the material presented in this course has a potential to positively impact your ability to acquire computing skills and perform computing skill which will be used in your future careers; you put yourself in the best position to gain that understanding when you rely on your own work.</p><p>
