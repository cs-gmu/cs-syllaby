  <p><h3>Course Description:</h3> 
  CS 571 provides an introduction to the principles of operating systems theory and practice. Fundamental concepts such as processes, synchronization, scheduling, memory management, file systems, distributed systems, and security will be presented.</p>
  
  <p>This course will prepare you for further courses in the Systems and Networking area, to include <b>CS 635 (Foundations of Parallel Computation)</b>, <b>CS 672 (Computer System Performance Evaluation)</b>, and <b>CS 675 (Distributed Systems)</b>, among others.</p>

  <h3>Textbook</h3>
  <p>In this class, the main resource for the material will be the lectures and slides delivered by the instructor.  There are many, many different ways to approach these topics, and each operating system (and each different version or that code) may support completely different implementations. The lectures are the primary resource for the course.</p>

  <p><b>Required Textbook:</b> "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (Online Book, Arpaci-Dusseau Books) by R.H. Arpaci-Dusseau and A.C. Arpaci-Dusseau.<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Available Online for Free: <a href=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~Eremzi/OSTEP/>http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~Eremzi/OSTEP/</a></p></li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Recommended Textbook:</b> "The C Programming Language", 2nd ed. by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall, 1988.
  <ul>
    <li>All programming in this course will be done in the C programming language.  This book provides a good reference for C that may be helpful during the course.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Additional Resources:</b> The following older textbooks also are good resources.  These are not required, but if you would like additional references that cover the same topics, a recent edition of any of the following books will present in-depth discussions on the core topics.
  <ul>
    <li>Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne (John Wiley & Sons) </li>
    <li>Operating Systems - Principles and Practice (2nd Edition, Recursive Books) by Anderson and Dahlin </li>
    <li>Modern Operating Systems (Pearson) by A. S. Tanenbaum </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recommended Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>These are recommended prerequisites for this course.  <b>This course assumes you are comfortable with programming in C as a strong requirement.</b>  All programming assignments will be programmed in C and you will need to be able to read and assess existing C code as the starting point for your programming assignments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Grade of C or better in an Undergraduate Data Structures Course, <b>AND</b>
    <li>Grade of C or better in an Undergraduate Systems Programming Course, <b>AND</b>
    <li>Grade of C or better in an Undergraduate C Programming Course
  </ul>

  <h3>Topics for this Semester Will Include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Operating System Fundamentals</li>
    <li>Processes</li>
    <li>Concurrency and Synchronization</li>
    <li>CPU Scheduling</li>
    <li>Memory Management and Virtual Memory</li>
    <li>File and Storage Systems</li>

<!--[ZEUS]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=zeus class=main>
  <h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>Systems Programming</b> class.  Unlike a general-purpose C courses for any computer system, this course is based on building programs for a specific system.  For CS 571, that system is an emulated server that is running Zeus. </p>

  <p>Zeus is a Linux computer running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is administerd by the College of Engineering and Computing for our use.  Some of our programs will involve libraries that have been pre-built on Zeus, and some programs will use system specific features that may only build properly on Zeus.</p>

  <h3>Connecting to Zeus</h3>

  </ul>

  <h3>Zeus Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>All Programming Assignments must Compile and Run on Zeus</b> </li>
    <li> All Programming Assignments will be Tested and Graded only on Zeus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> You may develop wherever and using whichever tools you like. </li>
      <li> You will need to ensure your work builds and runs on Zeus before submission. </li>
      <li> A programming assignment that will not compile on Zeus cannot be graded. </li>
      <li> Remember, C has certain guarantees and others that are only 'system dependent'. It still needs to run properly on Zeus to be graded. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> You will need to set up the Campus VPN to access Zeus from off-campus. </li>

<!--[HONOR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=honor class=main>
  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  <p>The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must ensure that all work that should be your own is your own.</p>

  <p>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to compare your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity. Repeat to yourself: it's not worth trying to cheat. We will catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.</p>

  <p><b>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The usual recommendation is failure in the course.</b></li>
    <li>It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a semester and lose some implicated friends; please don't put yourself through that experience!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><b>Honor Code Policies</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to use code from the Internet.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes Stackoverflow, Chegg, Github, ReplIt, TutorialPoint,  or any other site with code.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to discuss any implementation (code) or design decisions with any other student.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes prior students and students from other sections.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to share or use any code from any other student (including past students)</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes posting your code to a public GitHub repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>


  <h3><b>Honor Code Responsibilities</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>It is your responsibility to ...</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> lock your computers with a password,</li>
      <li> not post your code to websites like Pastebin or ReplIt that are publicly accessible,</li>
      <li> not post code to any public repositories,</li>
      <li> (If you use services like Github/Gitlab) make sure your repo is set private.</li>
      <li>  guard your USB drives and computers,</li>
      <li>  not upload your files to someone else's computer, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You will be liable for any access gained to your public or unprotected code.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> If you are in a team with other students for another class, ensure CS 571 files are protected.</li>
      <li> Make sure none of your work is possible to access by any other student.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>GTAs are allowed to help you in your Programming Assignments!  But there are some limitations.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>TAs can help you with designing data structures, the overall algorithm used, C programming in general, and fixing any bugs.</li>
      <li>TAs can not give you code, allow you to copy code from someone else, or help you write your code.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

    <li>If we ever do have to have an online session (eg. Snow Day), I will <b>Never</b> require anyone to have any cameras/webcams active.</li>
    <li>I believe that requiring any video from you for an online lecture is an invasion of your personal privacy and of your space.</li>
    <li>I will never require or even allow the use of any video cameras.</li>
    <li>Others may have different policies, and that's for them to decide on the best policies for their own courses.  This is simply my own personal policy.</li>

  We are quite happy to assist as is appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time by ODS. <br><br>
