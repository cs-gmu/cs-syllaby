	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What book will we use?</span>
			Kleinberg and Tardos, <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kleinberg-Algorithm-Design/PGM319216.html">Algorithm Design</a>, 2005. ISBN: 9780321295354
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is the book <i>really</i> required?</span>
			Yes. Reading will be a substantial part of this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where can I get the textbook?</span>
			The university bookstore should have the book, but it's also available
			new, used, and for rent from most major booksellers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">When should I read the book?</span>
			Everyone's learning style is different, so some may prefer to 
			read the book first then come to lecture, while others may prefer to 
			hear the lecture and then read afterwards. This is entirely 
			your choice, but you do need to read as it is an integral 
			part of the course and important for fully understanding the 
			class material.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have difficulty learning from written
			material, what should I do?</span>
			If you find you have difficulty reading the textbook for some
			reason, please come talk to me! There are likely strategies
			that can make it easier (and even more enjoyable). Learning
			from written material is an important skill for all engineers,
			scientists, and programmers.

			of the JDK you can put on a thumb drive (such as those available here:
			https://portableapps.com/apps), which may be helpful.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if we need to move online?</span>
			At the moment I do not foresee any movement back to all-online learning.
			However, just in case, everyone should be prepared to move online if

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2 onclick="showHide('3.1')">3.1 Semester Grades <span style="font-size:50%">(click to expand)</span></h2>

	<div class="hidden" id="3.1">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What things will be graded?</span>
			You will be doing three main things for grades: coming to class,
			doing homework, and taking exams. The first part (coming to class)
			will be graded by various activities in class. Homework will have
			alternating formats: code and non-code. Exams will be a midterm
			and a final. There is much more extensive information on these
			materials in the sections below.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How much is each task worth?</span>
			<br />The following is a breakdown of the class tasks by topic and sub-topic:
			<br />
			<br />
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How do semester grades equate to letter grades?</span>
			We will be using the +/- system in the following way:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A+ (&gt;= 98%) A (&gt;= 92%) A– (&gt;= 90%)
				</li>
				<li>
					B+ (&gt;= 88%) B (&gt;= 82%) B– (&gt;= 80%)
				</li>
				<li>
					C+ (&gt;= 78%) C (&gt;= 72%) C– (&gt;= 70%)
				</li>
				<li>
					D (&gt;= 60%)
				</li>
				<li>
					F (&lt; 60%)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, you must pass <i>at least</i> one exam in the class (60% or higher) to pass the class (receive a non-F grade).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Do you round?</span>
			I do not round individual components (exams, homework, etc.), but 
			I do round the semester grade up to the nearest whole number before 
			determining the letter grade. Please do not ask for more rounding.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Do you curve?</span>
			I do not curve grades, and you should never ask anyone for
			a curve. A real curve pits students against each other and your grade
			might go <i>down</i> if there is someone very talented in your class.
			At its heart, a curve is a promise to fail some percentage of the
			students in the class, and I'd prefer everyone be able to pass by
			doing the work, even if everyone else is also doing the work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Ok... then do you curve <i>up</i>?</span>
			Not for the semester grades, but if I belive there is 
			something "off" about the grades on some particular assignment (based
			on my knowledge of the class in general, historical information, etc.),
			I will make appropriate adjustments to that one item.
			Please understand that all adjustments must be consistent with the
			grading shown above and <i>fair for all students</i>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I do additional work or redo assignments
			at the end of the semester?</span>
			There will be no make-up assignments or unannounced
			extra-credit opportunities at the end of the semester;
			your grade should be a measure of your semester-long progress.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I <i>need</i> to pass this class?</span>
			If you tell me at the start of the semester, we can definitely work
			together to make sure you're on track and work out any recovery
			that needs to happen if you start to struggle. Every semester I
			have one or more students who "check in" with me during office
			hours because they need the extra support, reassurance, or just
			some accountability. This is a <i>perfect</i> use for office hours.
			If you tell me at the end of the semester that you needed to pass
			but aren't currently passing, then there will be nothing I can do
			to help!

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2 onclick="showHide('3.2')">3.2 Class Participation <span style="font-size:50%">(click to expand)</span></h2>

	<div class="hidden" id="3.2">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How do I get credit for participation?</span>
			Most lectures will contain one thing you need to do to get credit
			for participating in that lecture. That thing will vary from
			class-to-class, but usually it will be something related to the
			work we're already doing together.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss a lecture!?</span>
			At the end of the semester, I will drop your lowest two participation
			scores. This should cover situations where you are unable to come to class 
			(due to illness, forgetfulness, outside responsibilities, etc.), and also
			cover situations where you just "didn't do well". There will be no makeup
			participation for any reason.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I work in groups?</span>
			It will depend on the participation activity whether or not you can
			work with others. You may never work with people who aren't in the
			room (or at least, they can't get participation for helping you).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Do I have to work in groups?</span>
			Have to? No. But keep in mind that when you go out into industry (soon),
			your hire-ability will be greatly impacted by your ability to communicate
			with people you don't know. Also, research says you'll learn easier
			if you work in groups, so if groups are being encouraged for some
			participation activity, try to join one.

	<h2 onclick="showHide('3.3')">3.3 Homework<span style="font-size:50%">(click to expand)</span></h2>

	<div class="hidden" id="3.3">
	<p>General Homework Questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What types of homework will there be?</span>
			You will have paper-and-pencil homework some weeks and coding
			assignments in other weeks. See schedule (on Piazza) for exactly
			which when.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where will I submit homework?</span>
			Homework will be submitted to Blackboard or GradeScope depending on the
			assignment.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Will you "drop" one or more homework assignments?</span>
			No. This is a senior-level class. No homework can be dropped for
			any reason (except emergencies, see questions below in "Homework
			Issues and Potential Problems").
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I work in a group?</span>
			Some homework has group options in this class. Those that do will
			explicitly state how many people, how grading works, etc. Otherwise
			homework is considered <i>individual</i> effort.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where can I work with my group?</span>
			GMU offers several
			<a href="https://its.gmu.edu/service/collaborative-learning-areas/">
				Collaborative Learning Areas
			</a> around campus if you need things like roll-out whiteboards, 
			LCD wall monitors, movable tables, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Are there any minimum requirements for
			programming assignments?</span>
			For all coding homework, your programs must compile on Java 1.9
			or higher to receive credit. All other requirements will be
			specified on a homework-by-homework basis.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>Getting Help on Homework:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How can I get help on homework?</span>
			Homework help is available in-person before/after class or in office
			hours, but the discussion board (Piazza) also gives a way to get
			asynchronous help. Don't spend hours banging your head against a wall,
			come get help!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where and when are office hours?</span>
			These will be posted on Piazza as either a pinned post or on the
			"Resources" page, "Staff" tab.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I discuss my homework with others?</span>
			Unless it's someone in your group for a group homework, no sharing
			of code or solutions, and no discussion of problem solutions is
			allowed with anyone except the TAs or me. You may not use the internet
			to find, develop, or solicit help for code, assignments, or any other
			individual work. See section 4.1 on the Honor Code.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How can I get getter at time management so
			I'm not doing everything at the last minute?</span>
			Instructors can often help with this, but
			<a href="https://learningservices.gmu.edu">GMU Learning Services</a>
			offers a lot of support options for time management improvement as well.
			Whatever you do, don't hide the problem, talk to someone about it!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What can I do to improve my writing skills
			(so that I don't lose points on homework or exams)?</span>
			I'd recommend working with the
			<a href="https://writingcenter.gmu.edu"> Writing Center</a>.
			They also have specific resources to assist with
			<a href="https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/for-esol-students">
				English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>Homework Issues and Potential Problems</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I submit the wrong files electronically?</span>
			Just like turning in the wrong homework in-person, turning in
			the wrong homework electronically will result in a zero. Just because it's
			easy to make a mistake, doesn't mean you shouldn't double check
			your submission (in fact, it means the opposite!).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I make a "stupid" mistake on
			my homework?</span>
			It happens, but it also has consequences. To prepare you for the
			cautiousness you need when working in a professional environment,
			you will not be able to fix <i>anything</i> after submission,
			even if it is a simple mistake. That's what the time before
			submission is for. Make sure to dedicate specific time to looking
			over your work before submission.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if Blackboard or Gradescope is down?</span>
			In the rare situation that a website/tool/service is somehow
			unavailable or giving an error, you are still responsible for 
			turning in on time. Just email your submission to me before
			the deadline and explain what happened.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if my computer crashes and I lose
			my work?</span>
			To ensure professional practices in our senior student body, 
			catastrophic computer failure will not be considered a reason
			for an extension. As this is a senior level CS course, you
			can practice the professionalism you'll need in the workplace
			by backing up your work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What type of backup should I use?</span>
			You can use online services like OneDrive (free to students, see: 
			<a href="https://its.gmu.edu/service/office-365-onedrive/">
			https://its.gmu.edu/service/office-365-onedrive/</a>), or
			something as simple as emailing things to yourself at the
			end of each day, whatever gets the job done!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss (or will miss) a homework 
			deadline because of some sort of emergency?</span>
			If you need an extension or miss a due date because of a
			university-accepted emergency (such as being taken to the
			hospital), just notify me within 24 hours to make arrangements.
			If you provide documentation of the emergency and your involvement
			we will work out something that makes sense for the situation.
			I may elect to "exempt" a missed homework rather than give an
			extension under certain circumstances. In this case, other homework
			in the same <i>sub</i>-category will gain more weight.
			Unfortunately, to ensure the class moves forward for everyone,
			failure to follow these policies will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss a homework deadline
			for some other reason?</span>
			Missing a homework due date for any non-university-accepted
			reason (such as not paying attention to when the due date is),
			will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I know I will need an extension
			in advance?</span>
			Extensions require <i>exceptional</i> circumstances (as judged by me)
			and must be arranged in advance. I don't give extensions <i>on
			or after</i> the due day unless you have a university-accepted
			emergency. Normal obligations such as family or friend events,
			vacations, or other classes are <i>not</i> exceptional circumstances
			(unless hospitals are involved!).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can the TAs give me an extension?</span>
			Nope. Just me. GTAs cannot approve late submissions or extensions.

	<div class="hidden" id="3.4">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is there a minimum final exam grade to pass the class?</span>
			You must pass at least <i>one</i> exam in the class
			(midterm <i>or</i> final) with a grade of 60% or
			higher to receive a non-F semester grade. Extra credit
			<i>is</i> taken into account for this calculation (so earning
			58pts/100pts on a midterm, +2pts of extra credit on the
			midterm, would be considered a 60%).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What can I bring to an exam?</span>
			Exams are closed book/notes unless otherwise specified.
			Resources available during exams will be specified
			by me on a exam-by-exam basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What <i>must</i> I bring to an exam?</span>
			You will need to have your GMU identification available on
			exam days (and you will be required to show a photo ID as part
			of the exam process). Alternative <i>photo</i> IDs options
			may be required if your GMU ID is unavailable or unreadable.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I work in a group on my exam?</span>
			Studying beforehand? Yes. During an exam? No. All exams are 
			considered <i>individual effort</i>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss the exam because of 
			some sort of emergency?</span>
			If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
			absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
			the exam), just notify me within 24 hours of your absence 
			to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring approved
			documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
			I may elect to replace a missed midterm with some (or all) of the final
			exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam under certain circumstances.
			Unfortunately, to ensure the timely return of grades and ensure the class
			progresses through the semester at the same pace, failure to follow these
			policies will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss an exam for some other reason?</span>
			Missing an exam for any non-university-accepted reason (such as 
			not paying attention to when the exam is), will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I know I will miss an exam in advance?</span>
			Early or late/makeup exams require exceptional circumstances
			(as judged by me) and must be arranged in advance.
			Vacation plans are not exceptional circumstances.
			I may elect to replace a missed midterm with some (or all) of the final
			exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam under certain circumstances.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What should I do if I have test anxiety?</span>
			This depends on the severity of your anxiety. Instructors can often
			give you some advice on this, but there are three other resources you
			might want to be aware of. One is
			<a href="https://learningservices.gmu.edu">GMU Learning Services</a>
			which offers a lot of support options for test taking skills and
			overcoming test anxiety. The second is talking to
			<a href="https://caps.gmu.edu">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>
			if the anxiety is very severe. If you have a documented anxiety disorder, then
			the third option is the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of
			Disability Services</a> (see section 5.1).
			Whatever you do, don't hide the problem, talk to someone about it!

	<div class="hidden" id="3.5">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I contest grades?</span>
			Of course! No one is perfect. If you feel that points have been
			incorrectly deducted for any reason, just contact the grader for
			that item. For homework, that is your GTA. For exams, that's me.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is there a deadline for contesting grades?</span>
			To ensure that regrade-requests are manageable, contesting grades
			on submissions must be requested within one week of receiving the
			grade (on BlackBoard or GradeScope). No grade changes will be
			considered subsequent to that deadline or subsequent to the final
			exam (whichever comes first). For recording errors (e.g. GradeScope
			says 8/10, but Blackboard says 5/10) there is no time limit.

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->

	<div class="hidden" id="4.1">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the GMU Honor Code?</span>
			The <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU Honor Code</a>
			describes the behaviors that are not allowed in an academic setting,
			such as cheating, plagiarism, stealing, and lying. This policy is
			rigorously enforced. All students must abide by the GMU Honor Code.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the CS Honor Code?</span>
			The computer science department has a
			<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code</a>
			that you are also subject to. The document helps you to understand
			how GMU honor code applies to CS, such as what constitutes cheating
			in a CS setting, and it clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
			sorts of assignments.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the Honor Court?</span>
			If you are suspected of violating the GMU or CS Honor Code,
			you will be referred to the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu">
			Office of Academic Integrity</a> who will present you with
			options, such as contesting the charge or admitting the
			violation. The purpose of the honor court is to hears both
			sides in the case. This way it is
			not your professors who get to determine what occurred and
			professors can't unilaterally take action against you.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is the Honor Court a sentencing court?</span>
			No. The honor court is there to ensure a fair hearing before
			punishments are given. The referral to the the 
			<a href="https://oai.gmu.edu">Office of Academic Integrity</a>
			is not a punishment in itself, it is a way of getting the
			situation clearly understood before any penalties are applied.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What happens if I violate the honor code
			(cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie)?</span>
			The CS Department take the honor code quite seriously. Any
			violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated.
			The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
			than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.
			<i>Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course
			failure.</i> Suspected cheating will be referred to the Honor
			Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What happens if someone steals my work?</span>
			It is your responsibility to lock your computer(s) with
			a password, to not post your work to websites like Pastebin
			that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
			computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
			computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
			your work resulting from poor computer security practices.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can you give me an example of cheating?</span>
			There are many examples in the honor codes listed above,
			if you are ever unsure of what would/wouldn't be cheating, just ask!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Why can't I do ___? I hear that's what they do
			in industry. Why is that cheating?</span>
			If you want to play in a band, you need to know how to
			play your own instrument. School is like learning to play
			the instrument, industy is like being in the band. 
			I worked for over a decade in industry, so I know what
			people do and don't do, come talk to me if you want a much
			longer discussion of this :)
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">People on the internet say CS professors
			will send me to the honor court for no reason, what should I do?</span>
			First, if that were to happen, the 
			<a href="https://oai.gmu.edu">Office of Academic Integrity</a>
			would just dismiss the case. You can't refer someone without evidence.
			If you have someone telling you this, just ask to see the 
			evidence and decide for yourself (they will have been given this as
			part of their referral).
			Second, professors don't get anything out of referring students,
			it's a process that takes hours to do (per student), and not
			something anyone would do for fun.
			Third, if you do know someone whose case was dismissed by the
			honor court, it doesn't mean they were referred "for no reason",
			the purpose of the referral is to get all the evidence out in
			the open and determine what happened. So just being found "not in
			violation" does not mean there wasn't a reason to investigate the
			situation.
			And finally, don't trust people on the internet to tell the
			truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I give material on Piazza/Blackboard/Gradescope/etc.
			to others?</span>
			Please don't share any course material unless you've been authorized to
			do so (by me!). There are copyright issues (and privacy issues in some
			situations) that you might not be aware of. So please ask first!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I post course materials to the internet?</span>
			All course materials posted to Blackboard or other course sites
			are private and much of it is copyrighted. Additionally, by federal law,
			any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice,
			or image) must not be shared with anyone not enrolled in this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I record the class or post recordings
			of the class?</span>
			By federal law,
			any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice,

			Therefore, video recordings of in-person class meetings that include
			audio or visual information from other students is private and must
			not be shared.
			And also recordings of video conference meetings (e.g. Collaborate or Zoom) 
			that include audio or visual information from other students must 
			be viewed privately and not shared. 
			If you need to record the class due to a documented medical condition,
			you will need to sign a waiver (please ask for this).

			If you wish, please share your name and/or gender pronouns

		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How can I refer to you?</span>
			You can address any instructor as "Prof. [LAST NAME]" in email
			and verbally if you aren't sure of their personal preferences.
			"Dr. [LAST NAME]" also works for professors with PhDs.
			For me, I personally identify as female, but I dislike my gender
			being highlighted (so I dislike being called "Miss", "Mrs.", or
			"Ms.") and prefer a neutral title, such as "Prof." or "Dr.".

		<li>
			<span class="question">I got injured and it's impacting my ability
			to do class tasks and/or homework. What should I do?</span>
			The <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability 
			Services</a> also handles services for many temporary disabilities
			(for example, if you break your arm, they can arrange note taking 
			services). Please contact them if you discover any sudden impairment 
			that affects your ability to function in class and/or on your projects. 
			They have a quick and easy registration process. All you need is 
			documentation for your condition.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have an undocumented disability,
			or other condition that impacts my learning. What should I do?</span>
			This depends a lot on the nature of your condition, but generally it's
			best to talk to someone about what's happening. Often instructors can't 
			offer support on an ad-hoc basis, but they can often help you
			determine if the situation might be helped by some coaching
			(e.g. minor test anxiety), counseling (e.g. major anxiety), or
			something you can get temporary support for from the
			<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a> (e.g.
			a broken arm).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have a documented physical or learning
			disability. What should I do?</span>
			If you have not yet registered with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office 
			of Disability Services</a>, you should. This office offers
			accommodations (such as extended time on projects and/or exams,
			quite testing environments, lecture recording waivers, etc.) to
			assist with everything from broken arms to chronic/acute depression
			and anxiety. I'd highly recommend talking to them if you think any
			of their services might help. Every student I know who works with
			them speaks highly of them. They have a quick and easy registration process. All you need is
			documentation for your condition.
			Even if you don't know whether you'll
			need to use  the accommodations, it's best get your condition
			documented with the university as accommodations are not retroactive.

			<span class="question">I am registered with the 
			<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a>, but
			I'm not sure if I want to use the accommodations. What should I do?</span>
			For all your classes (not just this one), you should still speak with
			your the instructor to discuss your approved accommodations.
			Even if you don't know whether you plan on using the accommodations, 
			once an instructor knows you have them, you can easily begin using
			them if the need arises. It's better to be over prepared than under
			prepared, since accommodations are not retroactive.
