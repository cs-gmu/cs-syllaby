  <dt> <b>Course Description</b> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Concepts and techniques in data mining and multidisciplinary
  applications. Topics include data cleaning and transformation;
  classification and predictive modeling; clustering; association
  analysis; performance analysis and scalability; data mining in
  advanced database systems, including text, audio, and images; and emerging themes and future
  challenges. Students will gain hands-on experience and learn how to
  implement and apply various data mining algorithms.<br>

  <dt><b>Prerequisites </b></dt>
</dl>

<ul>

  <li>Formally: Grade of C
or better in CS 310 (Data Structures) and STAT 344 (Probability and
Statistics) or equivalent.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>More specifically: Programming experience in Python preferred.
Experience in Java or C++ will work as well, but the assignments will
  use the Python framework. Students should be familiar with basic probability and
statistics concepts, and linear algebra. Please expect lots of
programming in the assignments.</li>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Assignments</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be 4-5 competition-style programming assignments in
  Python. Competition winners will get 1%
  extra credit added to the final grade.</p>
    <p> </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Exams</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be quizzes throughout the semester covering lectures
  and readings, and one final exam. The purpose of the quizzes is to
  help you stay on track of the lecture materials, so they are
  typically short and easier compared to the final exam. The final exam is comprehensive. All exams are closed-book, and they must be taken at the scheduled time, unless prior arrangement has been made with the instructor. Missed exams cannot be made up. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</p>

  <dt><b>Class Participation</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be able to earn class participation credit through
  in-class activities.

<!--  <dt> <b>Project</b></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>There will be one team project in the semester. The project
grade
consists of project proposal (including project pitch, 5% total of
overall course grade), video presentation (5%), and project report and code
(20%).<br>

Code Statement</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU
Honor Code</a> is in effect at all times. In addition, the CS
Department has further honor code policies regarding programming
projects, which are detailed <a
      href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">here</a>. Some
      examples can be found <a
      href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/honor-code-examples/">here</a>. Any
      deviation from the GMU or the CS department Honor Code is
considered an Honor Code violation. All assignments for this class are <u><b>individual</b></u>
unless otherwise specified. ChatGPT or other Generative-AI models may
      NOT be used in this course as an assistant in the assignments. </p>

    <dt> <b>Learning Disability Accommodation</b> </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other
condition
