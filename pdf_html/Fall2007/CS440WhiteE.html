Course Content</H2>
This course will cover the theoretical and implementation aspects of language
processing. Emphasis will be on the design and construction of compilers.
There are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this
course.

Grading Policies</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
There will be 3 programming assignments, together worth 40% (10+15+15) of your grade.
These are to be <B>individual</B> efforts, meaning no sharing of code or
discussion of problem solution allowed with anyone but me or the TA. See the class website for the late policy. 
<li> Homework (10% of your grade) will be assigned periodically.  Homework may be done individually or in groups.  Late homework will
be accepted with a penalty of 20% per day.
<LI>
There will be a midterm exam during the semester, worth 25% of your grade.</LI>

<LI>
The final exam, worth 25% of your grade, will be commulative with the primary
emphasis (70-90%) on the material not tested in earlier exams.</LI>
All exams are closed book. 
You must have a written
excuse (doctor's note, for example) to miss an exam. I reserve the right
to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written.</LI>

<LI>
It has been my experience that time is the biggest determiner of your final
grade in this class. I suggest that you start assignments when I hand them
out. They often take more time than you think.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Honor Code</H2>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts. Information on the university honor code
can be found in the <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/#Anchor12">university catalog</A></TT>
<P>
This semester I will probably be using similarity detection software to 
assist me in finding honor code violations, should they occur.
