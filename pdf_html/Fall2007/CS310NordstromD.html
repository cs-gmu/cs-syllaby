</font><h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Textbook</font></h3>
<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">The text is Michael Main, <em>Data
Structures & Other Objects Using Java</em>, 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley 2006.
</font></p>

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">The course</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">
CS 310 and INFS 590 are being combined into one course as a part of
the merging of the Computer Science and the Information Systems
departments.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">The prerequisite for this course is C or
better in CS 211 (or equivalent for students coming from INFS).  I
will assume that you have developed a significant degree of skill in
programming (program organization, coding, documenting, testing and
debugging) -- you will develop yet more this semester.  I will also
assume that you are acquainted with basic complexity analysis ("big
O"), are happy manipulating pointers and linked data structures, and
can think recursively.  You should be able to build abstract data
types using Java classes.  </font></p>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">The purpose of the course is two-fold.
We will continue the study of data structures from CS 211 and we will
learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming projects
than those you did in CS 211.  We will cover essentially the second
half of the textbook. Programming is a significant part of this course
and you should expect to spend a good deal of time on the course
projects.  </font></p>

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Topics</font></h3>
<font face="serif" size="+1">Topics to be covered include:<br>
</font><ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1">
<li>generic typs</li>
<li>organizing programs</li> 
<li>balanced trees</li>

<li>searching and sorting</li>
<li>set representations</li>
<li>hashing</li>
<li>graphs</li>
<li>whatever else seems fun</li>
</font></ul>



<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Programs</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website</font></p>

<p><font face="serif" size="+1"> You may discuss the programming projects with 
other students (this is encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.  
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies"
name="[http://cs.gmu.edu/studtents/honor-code.html]">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>, and the University honor code: <a
href="http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html"
name="[http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html]">http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acad
pol.html</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</font></p><p><font
face="serif" size="+1"> You will submit programs electronically and
you will also hand in a hard copy of your source code.  External
documentation will be handed in with the hard copy of your program.
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate deleted my program" are

<i>not</i> reasons for late submissions).</font>
</p>

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Grading</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</font></p>

<ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1"><li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</font></ul>
