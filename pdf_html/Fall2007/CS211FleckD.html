Computer Science II (3:3:0) Prerequisite: grade of C or better in CS
112. Continuation of CS 112. Topics include abstract data types and
data structures (sets, files, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues,
trees, graphs) and examples of applications. Emphasis on program
development reinforced through several larger programming projects.
Additional programming language instruction supplements major topics.<br><br><hr style="height: 2px; width: 70%;">

Policy</span> <a href="#top">(top)</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exams</span><br>Quiz
and exam dates in the schedule below most likely will not be changed.
If you know in advance that you will miss a midterm exam, please let me
know ahead of time so that I may schedule one make-up exam date for
all. If an emergency occurs and you miss an exam without prior
arrangements, I will expect some proof of the emergency. The make-up
exam more than likely will not be the same as the scheduled exam. There
will be no make-ups for quizzes. However, you do not need to take all
quizzes; see my grading policy below.<br><br>
<table style="width: 65%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 159px;">Quizzes and Labs</td><td style="width: 13px;">15%</td><td style="width: 531px;">Each lab and quiz will have equal
weight. Your average will be calculated from at most the top 75% of
your lab and quiz grades.<br></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 159px;">Projects</td><td style="width: 13px;">40%</td><td style="width: 531px;">There will probably be 4 projects.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 159px;">Midterm
Exams</td><td style="width: 13px;">25%</td><td style="width: 531px;">There will be two midterm exams. The

Exam</td><td style="width: 13px;">20%</td><td style="width: 531px;">You must take the final exam to pass
this course.<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Your
final grade will be no worse than the higher of the grades determined
from your percentage grade and your class percentile as determined by
the table below. If I adjust the grading policy, it will be in your
favor and will apply to the class as a whole.<br><br><table style="width: 20%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>Percent</td><td>Percentile</td><td>Grade</td></tr><tr><td>98+</td><td>97+</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>93+</td><td>90+</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>90+</td><td>85+</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>87+</td><td>80+</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>83+</td><td>70+</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>80+</td><td>50+</td><td>B-</td></tr><tr><td>77+</td><td>40+</td><td>C+</td></tr><tr><td>70+</td><td>20+</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>60+</td><td>10+</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>else</td><td>else</td><td>F</td></tr></tbody></table><br>HONOR
CODE STATEMENT:<br>As with all GMU courses, this course is
governed by the GMU Honor Code. In this course, all assignments, exams,
and project submissions carry with them an implicit statement that it
is the sole work of the author, unless joint work is explicitly
authorized. Help may be obtained from the instructor or other students
to understand the description of the problem and any technology, but
the solution, particularly the design portion, must be the student's
own work. If joint work is authorized, all contributing students must
be listed on the submission. Any deviation from this is considered an
Honor Code violation, and as a minimum, will result in failure of the
submission and as a maximum, failure of the class.<br><br>PLAGIARISM: <br>Plagiarism is stealing the work of others and
presenting it as your own.&nbsp;This includes written papers, but also
computer programs, presentations, etc... anything that was not created
by you should be referenced. When in doubt, add a reference. If you
have any questions about whether you can or cannot use something you've
found ask your professor or TA. If another student let you copy their
work you are BOTH guilty. Any plagiarism violations will be sent to the
Honor Committee. If you are found guilty of plagiarism twice in your
university career you will be expelled. This is a very seriuous
offense! More information about plagiarism is on the <a href="http://www.writingcenter.gmu.edu/resources/handouts/plagiarism.pdf">writing center website</a> and at <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/">plagiarism.org</a>.
If you feel the need to do this for any reason, come talk to your
professor and we'll work out a better plan. There is ALWAYS a better
plan than plagiarising!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">This class will&nbsp;use automated tools to detect plagiarism (including written materials and source code).</span><br><br>DISABILITY STATEMENT:<br>If you are a student with a disability and
you need&nbsp;academic accommodations, please see me and contact the
Disability Resource Center (DRC) at 703.993.2474. All academic
accommodations must be arranged through that office.<br><br><hr style="height: 2px; width: 70%;"><br><br></body></html>
