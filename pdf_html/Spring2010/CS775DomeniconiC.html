     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>General Description and Preliminary List of Topics</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br>
     The course covers advanced topics in pattern recognition and machine learning.
     Recent conference and journal papers will be discussed in depth.
        Tentative topics: Mixture models and EM; Ensemble methods; Co-clustering; 
        Transfer learning; Semi-supervised learning; Learning with external knowledge;
        Generative approaches to topic modeling; Kernel methods.
        Actual topics covered will depend on time available and students' interests.

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Format</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br> 
     Lectures by the instructor, students' presentations, and discussions.
     Research papers and handouts will be made available.
     The course requires a project, homeworks and exams (exact format to be decided). 
     Homework assignments and project will require 
     some programming.<br>

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Project</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br>
The project gives you an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic/area of the course that interests you. The topic of the project, of course, should be related to the material covered in class, but otherwise you are free to select the specific topic. Possible types of projects include:
   <blockquote>
     <li>
     <b>An application research project</b>: The project demonstrates the application of some techniques discussed in class in an application domain (e.g., text mining, bioinformatics, computer vision, image processing,  artificial intelligence etc.). Properties, drawbacks, advantages of the used techniques are analyzed within the context of the explored application domain.     
     </li>
 
     <li>
     <b>A theoretical or methodological research project</b>: A study of different classes of models and approaches; proving either theoretically or experimentally properties of known algorithms; designing a new approach. 
     </li>

</li>
</ul>
