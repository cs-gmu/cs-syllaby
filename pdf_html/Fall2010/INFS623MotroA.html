<h2>INFS 623: Classical and Web Information Retrieval</h2>
<h4>Fall 2010 --- Prof. Ami Motro</h4>
<hr>
<p>
The need to locate information efficiently on the World-Wide-Web has moved the
traditional field of information retrieval (previously confined to
applications such as document retrieval from library collections) to the
center of the stage. This is demonstrated by the simple fact that these days
nearly everyone uses Internet search engines and is thus familiar with
previously obscure IR concepts such keywords, relevance, ranking, search
refinement, etc.  This graduate course is an introduction to the area of
information retrieval. This course has been revised and now covers principles
of both <b>Classical information retrieval</b> (e.g., the Boolean and vector
space model, document indexing, ranking, effectiveness measurement) and
<b>Modern information retrieval</b> (e.g., hypertext documents, Internet search
engines, Web crawling, link analysis).
<p>
Roughly speaking, the subject of INFS-623 is <i>complemetary</i>
to the subject of a database management course, such as <a href="http://ise.gmu.edu/~ami/teaching/infs614/infs614.html">INFS-614</a>:
Database Management, or <a href="http://ise.gmu.edu/~ami/teaching/infs760/infs760.html">INFS-760</a>:
Advanced Database Management. Whereas database management is
concerned mainly with storage and retrieval of <em>structured</em>
information, information retrieval is concerned mainly with storage
and retrieval of <em>unstructured</em> information, such as documents
and World-Wide-Web pages.
