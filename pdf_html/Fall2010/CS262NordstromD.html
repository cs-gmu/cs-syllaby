<H3>Textbook</H3>
<P>
The text is Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, <I>The C Programming Language</I>, 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 1988.
</P>
<H3>The course</H3>

<P>
Most high-level programming languages (and particularly Java) insulate the 
programmer from the realities of the hardware on which the programs will
run.  C is the exception since it was originally designed to implement
the Unix operating system.  C offers the programmer direct access to much
of the underlying hardware and, for programs running under Unix, direct
access to operating system services.  For these reasons C remains the
language of choice for systems programming.
</P>

<P>
This is a (short) course on "low-level" programming using C.  We will
learn C with heavy emphasis on pointer operations.
</P>

<H3>Topics</H3>

Planned topics include:
<UL>
<LI>C Types, Operators, and Expressions</LI>
<LI>Control Flow</LI>
<LI>Functions and Program Structures</LI>
<LI>Pointers and Arrays</LI>
<LI>Dynamic memory allocation</LI>
<LI>Structures</LI>
<LI>Bitwise operations</LI>
<LI>Input and Output Libraries</LI>
<LI>The Unix System Interface</LI>
</UL> 

<H3>Course outcomes</H3>

<P>
The students will:
</P><UL>
<LI>Be able to implement, test and debug a designed solution to a problem in a 
low-level programming language, specifically the C programming language.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate a good understanding of C language constructs such as pointers,
dynamic memory management, and address arithmetic.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate a good understanding of C libraries for input and output, and the
interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system.
</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate an ability to use UNIX tools for program development and
debugging.
</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>

<H3>Programs</H3>

<P>
There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website
</P>

<P>
You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<I>No joint work will be accepted.</I> Read the CS Department honor
code: <A href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</A>,
and the University honor code: <A href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">http://honorcode.gmu.edu
</A>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</P>

<P>
You can only turn in a program <I>once</I>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate ate my program" are <I>not</I>
reasons for late submissions).
</P>

<H3>Grading</H3>

<P>
There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <I>must</I> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>programs: 35%</LI>
<LI>midterm exam: 30%</LI>

<LI>final exam: 35%</LI>
</UL>
