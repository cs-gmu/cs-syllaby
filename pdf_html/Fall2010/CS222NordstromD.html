<H3><FONT size="+1" face="serif">The Course</FONT></H3>
<FONT size="+1" face="serif">The prerequisite is C or better in CS 112.  I will assume
that you have a basic understanding of the elements of programming in
some high level language..  The course
will be taught using C.  This is a terminal course in programming for
engineers and we will look at some aspects of the C 
language and programming issues with which engineers should be
familiar.

<H3><FONT size="+1" face="serif">Programs</FONT></H3>

<P>
<FONT size="+1" face="serif">There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT size="+1" face="serif"> You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<I>No joint work will be accepted.</I> Read the CS Department honor
code: <A href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies" name="[http://cs.gmu.edu/studtents/honor-code.html]">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</A>,
and the University honor code: <A href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">http://honorcode.gmu.edu
</A>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT size="+1" face="serif">You can only turn in a program <I>once</I>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate ate my program" are <I>not</I>
reasons for late submissions).
</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT size="+1" face="serif">Grading</FONT></H3>

<P>
<FONT size="+1" face="serif">There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <I>must</I> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
