<p><b>Course Prerequisites:  </b> CS 105; Completion of at least 60 credit 
 hours;    Concurrent enrollment or completion of all other general education 
 requirements.   </p>
               
<p><b>Required Textbooks:    </b>Herman T. Tavani, "Ethics &amp; Technology," 
   2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,. 2007;  Maddox, Tompkins, Maddox, "Supplementary Cases

   <b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students become 
   effective professionals in the field of computer science by examining many
   of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer technology
   and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. 
   Students will examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making
   and how to apply them to issues raised by computers and technology.  Specific
   topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns and software
   liability issues, will be addressed by this course in a more intensive
manner.    Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the computer profession
and   e-commerce will also be addressed.             
<p>Students will investigate the role of ethics for the computer professional 
   in various situations through individual and group work. Students should 
  be prepared to participate during class activities and to interact with 
their   classmates. Students will refine their personal points of view on 
various   ethical issues and consider how such issues - and their own views 
- impact   on professional colleagues, clients and the general public. </p>
