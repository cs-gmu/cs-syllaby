	  <b><h2>Aims:</h2></b>
	  <p>To introduce fundamental concepts underpinning computer games 
development and provide practical experience of the software 
engineering associated with computer games</p>
			<p></p>
			<b><b><h2>Course Outcomes:</h2></b></b>
			<ul>
			    <li>Become familiar with the underlying skills associated with computer games development</li>
  				<li>Understand different design issues related to computer games development</li>
    			<li>Realise the appropriate techniques used by developers during the production, deployment and maintenance of computer games</li>
    			<li>Be able to identify the mathematics associated with different aspects of computer games and utilize such knowledge in the development of computer games</li>
    			<li>Awareness of appropriate enabling technologies for computer games development and be able to exhibit skills appropriate for the development of a computer game via such technologies</li>
    			<li>Become capable of developing a complete game from basic computing resources</li>
			</ul>
<p></p>
<b><h2>Course Outline:</h2></b> 
		  	<ul>
    			<li><b>Introduction:</b> Genres, History, Design Basics</li>
    			<li><b>Movement:</b> Simple Animation, Blending, Physics</li>
    			<li><b>Reactions:</b> Collisions, Locating</li>

    			<li><b>Project:</b> 25%</li>
			</ul> 
<p></p>
<b><h2>Project Details:</h2></b> 
<p>Create a simple, fully functional game. Java should be the choice of language.
If another language is requested then this must be discussed with Graham first.
Game is marked on technical and playability criteria</p>	

<p></p>
<b><h2>Honor Code:</h2></b> 
<p>The class enforces the GMU Honor Code, and to the more specific honor code 
policy special to the Department of Computer Science. You will be expected to 
adhere to this code and policy</p>	

<p></p>
<b><h2>Disabilities:</h2></b> 
<p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may 
affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the 
Office of Disability Services</p>
