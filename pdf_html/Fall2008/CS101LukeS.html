<h1>Computer Science 101 / 001</h1>
<h2>Preview of Computer Science</h2>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Tuesday and Thursday, 1:30 to 2:45 PM, in Room 7 of the Science and Technology II building.  Yes, that's 2.5 hours for a 2 hour class.  Go figure!

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke.</a>
<p><h3>Teaching Assistant</h3> James O'Beirne
<p><h3>Requirements</h3> 
    <span class="list">1.</span><b>You must be a CS or Applied CS major.</b>  Likely majors may take the class with permission of the instructor.
    <span class="list">2.</span>All new CS or Applied CS majors must take this class at the same time as their <b>first CS class</b> (typically CS112, CS211, CS310, or CS367).  If your first CS class is in Spring, you may take CS 101 in the following Fall.
    <span class="list">3.</span>If your first CS class is not CS112, you may <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/">need to learn some basic Python.</a>  The professor will be glad to assist you in this.
    <span class="list">4.</span>There is no textbook.</span>


<p><h3>About the Class</h3> Computer science is not programming: programming is just one of several of the computer scientist's tools.  The class will introduce you to a variety of computer science topics, taught both by the professor and by various faculty in the department and other guest lecturers.  There will be at least one course project in small groups.

<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/cs101/">http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/cs101/</a>

<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be based on a combination of the following factors, each weighted approximately the same:
    <span class="list">1.</span>Class attendance and participation.
    <span class="list">2.</span>Participation in various sanctioned external activities and lectures related to computer science.
    <span class="list">3.</span>A group project, with some possible warm-up exercises.

<p>The instructor does not expect the class to have a final exam.  

<P><h3>Honor Code</h3> The class enforces the <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and to the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science.  You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.

<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you hve a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.

<p><h3>Course Outcomes</h3>

<span class="list">1.</span>An appreciation of the nature of computer science as a discipline, and its distinction from computer programming as an art. 

<span class="list">2.</span>A working knowledge of the breadth of subfields of computer science. 

<span class="list">3.</span>An ability to synthesize current working knowledge of programming (as taught in CS112) on the proposal of and development of independent project. 

<span class="list">4.</span>An ability to understand the relationship the computer scientist has with society, culture, and current issues. 

<span class="list">5.</span>An ability to work in teams.
