<a name="DESCR"></a><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> 

<blockquote> 
  <p>CS 451 is a 3-credit course with prerequisite MATH 203, CS 310, and CS 367. 
    It gives a general introduction to basic graphics principles, graphics software 
    design, and OpenGL programming. The programming platform is in Java or C. 
    The course will be taught in Java. The course will include lecturing through 
    the course notes, discussing the homeworks and the project, and student presentation 
    at the end. </p>

  <p>I am assuming you know the prerequisite material, Java (or C) programming, 

    vector analysis, and matrix calculations. After this class, you will be able 

    to do 2D/3D object transformation, rendering, and animation. Emphasis will 

    be on the programming and implementation. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Course Outcomes:</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>a) Apply trigonometry, geometry, vector analysis, and linear algebra to solve 
    real world problems. Students can develop objects transformation and their 
    own geometric transformation mechanism as the one implemented in the OpenGL 
    system.<br>
    b) Analyze object positions and movements to define the computing methods 
    and solutions for multiple objects&#8217; movements, relations, and collision 
    activities. Students can develop methods for objects moving and colliding 
    in 3D space. <br>
    c) Collaborate with classmates in teams in achieving the course project. Students 
    in teams are required to identify components to be implemented and efforts 
    to accomplish the components.<br>
    d) Understand and use the current techniques, skills, and tools in GPU programming 
    for advanced lighting calculations.<br>
  </p>

<a name="GRAD"></a><b>GRADING POLICY:</b> 

<blockquote> 

  <p>There are all together 100 points: </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Eight homework assignments (5 points)</li>
    <li> Four random in-class quizzes and class participation (5 points)</li>
    <li>One midterm exam (20 points)</li>
    <li>One project (20 points)</li>
    <li> One final exam (50 points)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your overall course score, S, will be the sum of these points. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> A: S is at least 90 points</li>
    <li> B: S is at least 80 points</li>
    <li> C: S is at least 65 points</li>
    <li> D: S is at least 45 points</li>
    <li> F: S is less than 45 points</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each assignment may not be accepted if it is not turned in on time. Therefore, 
    you should plan on working early. If you cannot finish your assignment, you 
    come to meet me or my TA during the office hours. </p>

  <p>If there is an accident or emergency and you let me know, I will consider 
    it accordingly. </p>

  <a name="GRAD"></a><b>OTHER POLICIES:</b> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>General Course Policies</strong></p>
  <p> * Policies regarding attendance and participation: if you miss a quiz, you 
    will not receive a grade for that quiz unless you have a serious reason, then 
    you will receive a grade for the quiz according to your final grade. </p>
  <p> * Policy regarding late assignments, make-up exams, and extra credit: no 
    late assignments, make-up exams, and extra credit in general. </p>
  <p> * Policy regarding incompletes: no incomplete in general. </p>
  <p> * Policy on electronic devices (cell phones, pagers, etc): should be turned 
    off. You can use a laptop in class if you want. </p>
  <p><strong>University Requirements</strong></p>
  <p> * Academic Honesty and Honor Code Statement: http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage</p>
  <p> * Disability Statement: If you are a student with a disability and you need 
    academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Disability Resource 
    Center (DRC) at 993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through 
    the DRC.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>You may form into <b>study groups</b>. You can meet with your study group 
    and discuss all homework questions freely and frequently in your group. <b>However, 
    you must do your own assignments. </b>In short, collaborate freely, acknowledge 
    all help and sources, and do your own work. </p>

  <p>Will be announced in class and mostly due before next class. Please submit 
    your source code to my TA through email. The midterm will be in-class in the 
    middle of the semester. The project will be announced by early November, and 
    is due by the end of November. </p>
