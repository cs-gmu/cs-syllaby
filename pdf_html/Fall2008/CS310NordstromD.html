<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>
The text is Mark Allen Weiss, <i>Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis
in Java</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., Addison Wesley, 2007.</p>

<h3>The course</h3>

<p>
The prerequisite for this course is C or
better in CS 211.  I
will assume that you have developed a significant degree of skill in
programming (program organization, coding, documenting, testing and
debugging) -- you will develop yet more this semester.  I will also
assume that you are acquainted with basic complexity analysis ("big
O") and are able to build abstract data types using Java classes.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the course is two-fold.
We will continue the study of data structures from CS 211 and we will
learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming projects
than those you did in CS 211.  Programming is a significant part of this course
and you should expect to spend a good deal of time on the course
projects.
</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<p>Topics to be covered include:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Generic types</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Stacks and queues</li>
<li>Binary trees</li>
<li>Balanced binary trees</li>
<li>Multi-way trees</li>
<li>B-trees and B+-trees</li>
<li>File organization</li>
<li>Searching and sorting</li>
<li>Set representations</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
</ul>
This list is subject to change as interest evolves.
<p></p>

<h3>Programs</h3>

<p>
There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website.
</p>

<p>
You may discuss the programming projects with 
other students (this is encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.  
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>
and the University honor code: <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu">
http://honorcode.gmu.edu</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  
Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.
</p>

<p>
External documentation will be written and handed in with your source code.
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate ate my program" are <i>not</i> reasons for late
submissions).
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</p>

<ul>
<li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</ul>
