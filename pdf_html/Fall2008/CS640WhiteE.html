Course Resources</H2>

You will need one of the following textbooks:
<UL>
<li> Engineering a Compiler, Cooper & Torczon
<LI>
"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools", A. Aho, M. Lam, R. Sethi and J.
Ullman (also known as the "dragon" book), 2007.  NOTE: the earlier edition is not sufficient

</UL>
There will also be papers (to be determined later)

<H2>
Related Resources</H2>
Some of the material from this course is also covered in:
<UL>
<li> Modern Compiler Implementation in Java, A. Appel, Cambridge Press.
<LI>
"High Performance Compiling for Parallel Computing", M. Wolfe</LI>  Focuses on issues for compiling to high performance architectures.
<LI>
"Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation" S. Muchnick, Morgan Kaufmann
Publishers, 1997.</LI> 
<li> "Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures", R. Allen and K. Kennedy, Morgan Kauffman Publishers, 2002.
</UL>

The last two texts are difficult reading, but are state of the art on this subject.

<H2>
Course Requirements</H2>

<ul>
<li> Exams: Midterm Exam (20%), Final Exam (20%) <br>
Both exams (midterm and final) will have an in-class portion and
a take-home portion.  The honor code will be in effect for both portions
of the exam, including the
take home portion</LI>
<li> Homeworks (20%)<br>
Homeworks may be done in groups or individually.</LI>
<li> Projects (40%)<br>
There will be at least three programming assignments, all requiring you
to implement algorithms we are studying.  These projects may assume standard front end skills you would acquire in a class like CS 540.
Programming assignments are to be individual efforts, unless I specify otherwise.
</ul>

You are expected to abide by the honor code for work done in this class.
All work is to be your individual effort unless I tell you otherwise.</LI>
