fundamental concepts in Data Mining  </P>
Course Outcomes: 
<UL>
  <LI>The ability to apply computing principles, probability and statistics relevant to the data mining discipline to analyze data. </LI>
  <LI>A thorough understanding of model programming with data mining tools, algorithms for estimation, prediction, and pattern discovery. </LI>
  <LI>The ability to analyze a problem, identifying and defining the computing requirements appropriate to its solution: data collection and preparation, 
functional requirements, selection of models and prediction algorithms, software, and performance evaluation.</LI> 
  <LI>The ability to understand performance metrics used in the data mining field to interpret the results of applying an algorithm or model, 
to compare methods and to reach conclusions about data. </LI>
  <LI>The ability to communicate effectively to an audience the steps and results followed in solving a data mining problem 
(through a term project)

<P><B>Class Attendance</B><BR>Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on time.&nbsp; I 
expect to start at 1:30 sharp; Please participate in class! Ask questions if 
there is something you don't understand. 
<P><B>Grading Policies</B><BR>There will also be written homeworks, a final project, a in-class 
midterm exam, and a final exam. Both the final and midterm are open-book and 
open-notes. The final exam will be <B>comprehensive</B>, i.e., it will cover the 
entire course. Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the 
exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the illness (doctor's note) is required.&nbsp; No 
early exams will be given and make-up exams are strongly discouraged. 
<P></P>End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows (tentative 
plan): 
<UL>
  <LI>25% Assignments 
  <LI>45% Exams 
  <UL>
    <LI>20% midterm 
    <LI>25% final </LI>
</UL></LI>
<LI>30% project </LI></UL>In order to obtain an A, your final score 
should be <I>at least</I> 90. A total score of 49 or less will result in an F. 
<P><B><A name=Late></A>Late Policy</B></P>Late homework will be accepted with a 
penalty of 20% per day within 3 days after deadlines and will not be accepted 
three days after due, unless under prearranged conditions. 
<P><B><FONT color=#d50000>Honor Code</FONT></B><BR>You are expected to abide by 
the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments and exams are individual efforts. Please 
refer to <A href="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">GMU Academic 
Policies</A> and <A 
href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">Computer 
Science Department Honor Code</A>.&nbsp; <B>Any violation of the honor code will 
result in a zero of the assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class.
