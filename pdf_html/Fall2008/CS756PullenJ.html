</p><p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</p><p><b>This course will enable the student to understand the principal factors
that influence the performance of packet switched networks supporting data
and multimedia applications, predict the impact of these factors on performance
by analytical and simulation techniques, and compare the predicted results
with actual measured performance. </b>
</p><p><b>Prerequisite: CS555, CS656 or other comprehensive course in networking basics
(includes background in computer architectures, statistics, ability to program in
C/C++/Java and use Unix operating system)</b>
</p><p><b><i></i></b>
</p><p><b>Project: Performance analysis of packet networking application using
(1) analytical techniques, particularly queueing theory, (2) simulation and/or
(3) actual measurement. Report on results. Students work in teams of one or two,
with project scope appropriate to the number on the team;
each member of team must be familiar with and responsible for all parts of project.
Topics and methods for project are proposed by students, confirmed by negotiation
with professor. Lab facilities will be made available as needed.
Methods are are described above; some example topics are:</b>
</p><p><b>Internet Protocol Multicast with Resource Reservation</b>
<br><b>Internet Protocol Version 6</b>
<br><b>Internet Protocol with Resource Reservation over SONET</b>
<br><b>Internet Integrated Services</b>
<br><b>Internet Differentiated Services</b>
<br><b>Reliable or Selectively Reliable Multicast</b>
<br><b>Ad-hoc and overlay networks</b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>GRADING POLICY</b>
</p><p><b>Queueing Theory Exam 30%, IETF Summary 10%, Project Proposal 10%,
Project Presentation 20%; Project Report 30%. Missed assignments
must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam date. Assignments
are due at 19:30 on the assigned date. Late assignments lose 10% per week
credit.

Each student is expected to comply with the Honor Code as stated
in the GMU catalog, and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
elaborated for Computer Science</a>.</b>

</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve); cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (and no higher than) A - 93; A- - 90; B+ - 87; B - 83; B- 90; C - 70.</b>

</p><p><b>Internet-based course delivery: The course will be presented in Room
320 ST2 but all classes will be available remotely using distance
education technology Network EducationWare. The requirement to participate is a
Pentium PC running Windows 2000/XP/Vista or Linux. Classes are delivered as graphics and
audio to the home or office desktop, with optional streaming video for those
with very good Internet connections to GMU. For details see
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/NEW">http://netlab.gmu.edu/NEW.</a></b>
</p><p><b>As part of the distance education approach, all classes are prepared
on slides. These will be available in Adobe PDF format for download
by 24 hours before class.</b>
</p><p><b>The Network EducationWare system offers the capability for online
students to meet with the instructor and make project presentations to the
class from their desktop computer, equipped with sound card and microphone.
Alternately, online students may come to the classroom to make their
presentation.</b>
