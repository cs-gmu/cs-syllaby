</p><p><b>Current Catalog Description</b>
</p><p><b>Data communication and networking protocols, with study organized to follow layers of the
Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP family of protocols). Topics include role of various media and
software components, local and wide area network protocols, network performance, and
emerging advanced commercial technologies.</b>
</p><p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</p><p><b>The course will present techniques and systems for communication of data
between computational devices and the layers of the Internet Protocol Suite.
Topics include the role of various media and software components, local and wide
area network protocols, network design, performance and cost considerations, and
emerging advanced commercial technologies. Emphasis is on the TCP/IP family of
protocols. The ISO 7-layer reference model to organize the study. Students will
program simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project.</b>

</p><p><b>Project: We will use the Java Network Workbench (JNW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the JNW environment. The projects will be coordinated by author Prof Mark Pullen (email: mpullen@gmu.edu).

JNW will be available for download from
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets">http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets</a>.
Well documented code must be submitted to Prof Mark Pullen for grading via an upload
webpage at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/CS455-upload">http://netlab.gmu.edu/CS455-upload</a>.
Additional projects will be available for extra credit. Student problems with
the project are to be addressed to Prof Mark Pullen; </b>
</p><p><b>The project is documented in one of the required texts.
Additional project information will be found at

</p><p>


</p><p><b>Project credit breakout: JDLC1, JDLC2, JLAN1, JWAN2, JTRN1 amd JTRN2 five
points each; extra credit assignments to be announced.</b>
</p><p><b>Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam
date.</b>
</p><p><b>Assignments are due by 14:00 on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit. No project submission will be accepted after last lecture day (12/5/2008).</b>
</p><p><b>All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
elaborated for Computer Science</a>. Students should be aware that their
submissions may be checked by plagiarism detection software.</b>
</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (but not higher than) A&nbsp; 93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B- 80; C 70.</b>
</p><p><b>Extra credit is available by doing extra projects; however, no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.</b> <br>&nbsp;
