<p>During lectures we will discuss programming concepts and instructors
will provide demos of programming relevant to other course work.
Programming labs will be for students to work on additional exercises
and get immediate help from teaching assistants.  In addition to
attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to
visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to
further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you

textbook which will be posted on the course web page.

involve either a short programming exercise or a quiz.  Lab
programming exercises will be submitted for automated grading online.

<p>
Associated with lab are readings from the Lab Manual posted online. It
is assumed that students read the scheduled lab manual sections prior
to each lab; doing so will make it relatively easy to complete the
labs during the allowed time.
</p>
<p>
During some labs, the lab leader will prompt the class to generate
potential quiz questions on the current lab topic.  Some of these
questions may be selected for use on a subsequent quiz or exam.

material.

Each programming project will have an "Honors Problem" which honor
section (H01) students must complete.  Other sections are not required

<li>Work turned in more than <b>three 24-hours periods late will earn zero   points</b> and will only be graded as time permits. To clarify, you can't
  use tokens and penalties to turn work in 4 days late; this would earn
  zero points.
</li>
<li>You can submit work to BlackBoard as many times as desired.  Only
  the last submission will be graded. If you anticipate being rushed
  around the submission deadline, be sure to submit a version before
  the deadline as a backup, in case you find yourself only moments
  late in meeting a deadline.

<li>GTAs grade the programming projects for the lab sections they teach.

<li>On-time submissions will generally be graded and available a week
  from submission, though exceptional circumstances may cause delays.
  Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as schedules

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions.</b>
</p>
<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
<b>PRIME DIRECTIVE.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Any attempts at cheating will not be tolerated</b>, and will be turned
in to the Honor Court with significant penalties recommended. You
should be familiar with both <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/honor-code/masons-honor-code/">the honor code at GMU</a> and the further
details of the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS Honor Code Policies</a>, but in short you should never
see, share, or discuss any part of the solution to any graded work,
from algorithm development to implementation to debugging to test
cases.  When in doubt, ask your instructor instead of another student.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to study with friends, the Lab Manual Readings and
associated exercises are a great, safe place to work on the course
materials in a stress-free environment with no worries about the honor
code. Learning together is valuable, but we need graded work to be
entirely completed individually.

<p><b>Bonus credit</b> will be awarded based on participation in class

of the alphabet.  Students with last names in that range may elect to
sit in the first few rows of the room and answer questions (hot
seats).  Reasonable effort on answering questions in class will garner
class participation credit.
</p>
<p>
The highest participation point winner at the end of the semester will
receive a 3% bonus to their overall score in the course.  All other
students will receive a bonus proportional to the highest point
winner.  For example, someone tied with the highest point scorer will
also receive a 3% bonus while someone with half the participation
points will receive a 1.5% bonus.

<h3 id="sec-7-2"><span class="section-number-3">7.2</span> Honors Section Differences</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">

<p>The honors section (H01) will be more difficult than other sections of
CS 211. Approximately 15-20% more work will be involved.
</p>
<p>
H01 will move through lecture material more quickly and explore
additional topics relevant to CS.  Students in H01 are expected to
keep up with these additional topics as they may appear on the H01
midterm and final exams.
</p>
<p>
Each programming project will have an "Honors Problem" which H01
students must complete.  These problems may reflect the additional
topics covered in lecture and often be more difficult than other
portions of the project.  
</p>
<p>
Grading projects for H01 students will be out of total points
available including the honors section: each project will have 100
points plus an honors section, frequently worth 20 points.  In such
cases honors students will be scored as X / 120 for a score of X.
Late projects will have the standard -25 deducted per day late.
</p><ul>
<li>An H01 student who turns a project in on time and receives a 99 on
  it willget 99/120 = 82.5% for the project.  
</li>
<li>If the same student turns in their work 1 day late without using a
  late token, they will receive min(99/120, 95/120) = 95/120 = 79.2%.

extra credit described in Prof. Kauffman's sections, I will include
extra credit opportunities on my tests/exams that may likely
pull from these only-in-class experiences. The same 3% maximum benefit
will be possible.
