<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help 
students become effective professionals in the field of computer science
 by examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues 
surrounding computer technology and its use, and building a foundation 
for dealing with those challenges. Students will examine the 
philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how to apply them to
 issues raised by computers and technology. Specific topics covered in 
CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns, will be addressed by 
this course in a more intensive manner. Emerging legal and ethical 
issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce will also be 
addressed. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, students will be expected to apply critical 
thinking skills in individual and group settings to evaluate various 
issues related to computer law and ethics. Students will connect issues 
of technology to wider societal concerns through class discussion, a 
mock trial, and in-class activities. Students will use critical thinking
 skills to evaluate and prepare formal arguments concerning their 
assigned mock trial topics, which they will present to their classmates.
 Students should be prepared to participate during class activities, to 
interact with their classmates, and to reflect upon and refine their 
personal points of view on various ethical issues. </p>
