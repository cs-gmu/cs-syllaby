the semester will be completing projects, as well as regular
assessments in lab (exercises, quizzes, and programming tasks).

In general, all grades should be available about one week after the
deadline. We will often have Sunday project deadlines (plus 48 hours
of late work accepted), so you would usually get a grade posted by the
following Wednesday.

<p>
<b>Each programming assignment is an individual effort; no collaboration allowed on projects.</b>
</p>


<p>
Programming projects will be a primary focus of your experience,
progress, and grade - each one should take multiple sessions of
coding, with questions asked in between. This is the practice you need
to learn, master, and internalize various concepts of the
course. Don't be surprised if you're spending 5-20 hours on each one.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

accelerated summer schedule; we operate at twice the pace, and
still get the entire course experience!

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each project has a posted deadline.
</li>
<li>No late work is accepted 48 hours after the posted deadline.
</li>
<li>Each student starts the semester with three <b>One-Late-Day</b> tokens.
</li>
<li>Late projects either automatically consume a late-day token when
available, or incur a 25% late penalty.
</li>
<li>projects can be turned in at most 48 hours late, <i>no exceptions.</i>
</li>
<li>each student gets three <b>One-Late-Day</b> tokens, which are
automatically used by submissions that are between 0-48 hours late.
you still must turn in work within 48 hours of the original
deadline, even if you use tokens! (note that you can't use three
tokens on a single project - pace yourself!)
</li>
<li>each day late (or portion thereof), when not covered by a token,
lowers the highest possible score by 25%. <code>recorded_grade =
   min(raw_score, 100-25*num_days_late)</code>
</li>


<li>the last project might not be allowed to be turned in late, to
facilitate end-of-semester grading.
</li>
<li>tokens are only allowed on projects; they can't be used on anything
else, so no usage on labs or readings.
</li>
<li>unused late-tokens will be worth a small bounty at the semester's
end (0.25% of the semester grade).

<p>
After the first two projects, any code turned in that does not run
(immediately crashes due to errors), specifically on Python 3.8.0,
will receive at most 50%. At this point, if the grader is able to
quickly fix your code, you might get some points back. If the grader
cannot immediately spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate to get
any points at all.

<p>
You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
and by default only the last version will be graded. You can also
download your submitted attempts, and verify that you turned in a
working copy.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turning in the wrong files (including empty or partial-work copies)
will likely result in a zero. 
</li>
<li>There is a difference between choosing to "save" your submission,
meaning you'll come back and finish turning in your work, and
choosing to "submit" your work, meaning actually sending the files
to the instructors at a specific timestamp as a submission. If
you've saved but not submitted, you haven't turned in your work
yet!
</li>
<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
extension. <b>Use a backup service</b> such as DropBox (or any cloud
service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
takes. Every semester multiple students have their computers die,
have computers stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the
student who forgot to (frequently) back up your work - it'll cost
tokens and a rushed re-implementation!

<li>All lab assessment grades will be averaged together evenly after
the drops.

<li>Lab quizzes and tasks require attendance at your <i>designated</i> lab
time to get the credit.
</li>
<li>Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the
reason why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major
award, getting married, saving the universe, etc.). This is the
reason you get lab drops!
</li>

<li>We will <b>drop the lowest two grades</b> from this category.
</li>

<li>If you choose to miss some early on, and later on have to miss for
some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save the drops
so you can actually throw out a bad grade, and not just hide a lazy
zero. Pretending you don't have them is your best approach.

<li>All students must have a working webcam and be able to use the remote proctoring software (Respondus).

</li>

<li>The final exam is cumulative. If you perform better on the final exam than your midterm exam, we will replace the midterm grade with the final grade.
</li>
<li>If you miss the final, there is nothing we can do for you. <b>Don't
miss the final!</b>
</li>

<li>If you know in advance that you are unable to make an exam for a
valid and unavoidable reason (such as a scheduled surgery,
naturalization ceremony, court date, etc.), you must notify the
professor at least one week before the scheduled exam date to make
arrangements for a make-up, and bring documentation with you when
you take the make-up.
</li>
<li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused absence
(such as an illness or car accident the day and time of the exam),
you must notify your professor within 24 hours of your absence to
make arrangements for a makeup, and bring approved documentation
with you when you take the make-up exam. Failure to follow either
of these policies will result in a zero.

<li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course with
knowledge of the schedule.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>SUMMER:</b> we will have our exam on the last day of class.

</li>

<li><b>You must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b> This is a
departmental policy for CS 112. You also need to have a passing
percentage grade, of course, but failure on the final exam
indicates a systemic lack of true progress. Generally, students who
fail the final exam do not have a passing grade in the course
anyways. ("passing" the final exam means scoring 60% or better.)
</li>

ambiguous or otherwise obviously unfair - I don't target some

grading comments under rare circumstances. For the midterm and final
exam, that is your professor.
</li>

<li>If you have not initiated contact within a week of a grade being
posted to BlackBoard, it is too late. We cannot entertain a swarm
of contested grades at the eleventh hour to try to maximize
end-of-semester grades. Keep up with your grades throughout the
semester.
</li>

<li>We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often
through specific test cases, which are often automated as part of
the grading process. All GTAs coordinate together with a shared
scoring breakdown and regularly communicate with each other before,
during, and after the grading process to keep it fair.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There is substantial support available to you in the form of office hours and and the online discussion board (Piazza). If you are having difficulty on a project or lab, we encourage you to reach out as early as possible. That said, to ensure fairness and facilitate learning, we have some basic rules for seaking help outlined below.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the is a discussion forum for you, the students, to discuss the course and the course material. There will be GTA assigned to check on this forum regularly and try to moderate the discussion, but this is NOT a replacement for office hours, reviewing lecture videos, or labs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Rules for Office Hours</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For students seeking help with programming assignments during
office hours, students must identify the line number, through debug
print statements, where they believe an error to be before seeing
the TA or instructor. This implies that you must have syntax errors
or at least one test case that fails, to bring to office hours
before the TAs or instructor can help you.
</li>
<li>For more general programming assignment questions, students must
bring their own pseudocode to office hours before the TA or
professor can help you.
</li>
<li>Under no circumstances will the professor or GTA reveal more than
three lines of code at a time during office hours. Students must
make significant, individual effort on all projects before coming
to see a GTA/professor. Waiting until the last minute, in the
expectations that the entire project will be explained in one
office hours session, is not feasible.
</li>
<li>Office hours are often crowded - do not rely on them for last
minute help, as we cannot guarantee that we will be able to spend
significant time with every student.
</li>
<li>If you have any questions about what you are/aren't permitted to do
on a project/lab and you and the TA cannot find a the answer
written somewhere, you should ask your professor. "So-and-so said"
will not be an accepted as a reason for grade re-evaluations
(unless "so-and-so" is your professor).

<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Rules for the Discussion Board</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students are encouraged to use the Piazza discussion board to ask
and answer questions about assignments, labs, course material, etc.
</li>
<li>No sharing answers or code solutions to assignments on the
discussion board. See Honor code section below for more details.
</li>
<li>Students can post questions and code privately, although the
instructor reserves the right to make any post public, so that
other students can see the responses.
</li>
<li>For students wishing to post their code privately to Piazza, the
same rules apply as when coming to office hours; if you have code
written, you must produce at least one failing test case where you
have identified what line number is giving you problems.
</li>
<li>GTA will be assigned to moderate the student discussion, help
review student answers, answer private questions, and address
questions which have not received a student answer. Therefore,
responses to questions can be expected within 24 hours, though
often times much sooner.
</li>
<li>Statements made on the discussion boards, even by TAs and
especially by other students, should NOT be considered the
definitive word on the subject unless it is verified by your
professor (in the assignment description, in class, posted on
Piazza, etc.). The GTAs can flag professors if/when clarifications
are needed.
</li>
<li>If you have any questions about what you are/aren't permitted to do
on a project/exam and you/others cannot find a the answer written
somewhere, you should ask your professor. "So-and-so said" will not
be an accepted as a reason for grade re-evaluations (unless
"so-and-so" is your professor).

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The Honor Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of
your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must
ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All students will abide by <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/">GMU's Honor Code</a>.
</li>
<li>All work must be your own.  If you are caught cheating, you and
every other involved student must be turned in to the honor court.
</li>
<li>See the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code Policies</a> to understand better what
constitutes cheating in the CS setting. It clarifies some
scenarios that are unique to our sorts of assignments.
</li>
<li><a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~marks/honor.txt">Understanding the Honor Code</a>: here are Dr. Snyder's own thoughts
about the purpose of the honor code in a computer science course.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply
will not be tolerated. <b>This includes using code found on the
internet</b>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero
grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases
of cheating almost always translate into course failure.
</li>

<li>There are definitely opportunities to study, work, and learn
together throughout this course - Zybooks questions, homeworks, and
more. Mostly you will need to work independently for any sort of
"test" (lab quizzes, lab tasks, midterm, final exam) and for
projects.
</li>

<li>discussing any individually assigned work with anyone other than a
course instructor or GTA is explicitly forbidden, regardless
of medium (in person, online, through "chat" features, etc).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from
a friend, or even to just work on the project on your own machines
next to each other, remember that it is just as easy to compare your
work automatically and electronically, and discover the similarities
in text and structure. We use automated software to flag suspicious
cases, and then review them by hand to find the cases that must be
submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity.  Repeat to yourself:
<b>it's not worth trying to cheat.</b> We will catch it, and sadly but
surely, we will turn it in.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented
with GMU's Office of Disability Services) that may impact academic
performance should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
appropriate accommodations. We are quite happy to assist as is
appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time. Bringing the
accommodation paperwork with you to a scheduled assessment is far
too late! Even if you don't know if you plan on utilizing the
accommodations ahead of time, it's in your best interest to prepare
ahead of time.
