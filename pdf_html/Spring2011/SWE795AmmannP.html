<h1>
SWE 795: Test Driven Development
</h1>
</center>

<hr>


<h3>
Course Description</h3>
This version of SWE 795 is about Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is 
built around the idea that tests can drive developement decisions about 
design, document design decisions about APIs, and serve as an executable
 reference for quickly identifying defects in code. TDD is a variant of 
Extreme or Agile programming. This class is about exploring the concepts
 underpinning TDD and also learning from how to apply it in practice.

Students have been asking for a course of this type for a number of 
years - here it is! I will run this course as a seminar rather than as a
 traditional lecture. Students should expect to contribute heavily to 
the class.
