<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Course Description and Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Modern engineering is almost always done using computers either as an
aid or a primary modeling tool.  To that end, it is essential for
engineers to have a cursory understanding of how to exploit
computation to meet their objectives.  This course will discuss
fundamental aspects of programming in the C language.  The C language
is designed to be close to the hardware on which it runs giving a
programmer full control over the machine.  This is in contrast to
higher level languages such as Python and Java which insulate the
programmer from hardware.  Programs in C have very direct access to
the underlying architecture of the execution device making C ideal for
applications in which careful control of the device is required.  This
is particularly relevant for engineers working with computing hardware
or other electronics.
</p>
<p>
Students in the course are assumed to have prior programming
experience (see prerequisites) so that basic programming concepts such
as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and aggregate data are
familiar.  We will cover how these elements are expressed in C and how
they are assembled to construct programs.  We will also cover the set
of tools which support C programs including compilers, preprocessors,
standard libraries, and potentially debuggers.  Near the end of the
course, we will spend a short amount of time discussing the C++
language which extends C to include some high-level programming
constructs.

<h3 id="sec-4-1"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Lectures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>Each lecture will be divided in half: 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture
and discussion followed by a 15 break and then another 1 hour and 15
minutes of lecture.  We will discuss programming concepts and I will
provide demos of programming relevant to assignments. In addition to
attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to
visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to
further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you
learn.
</p>
<p>
Attendance of lectures is expected but not mandatory.  Lectures are
meant to assist students in learning the material and meet
expectations on homework and exams.  However, no formal attendance
will be kept.  When attending lecture and discussion, students are
expected to arrive on time, avoid disruptions to presentations and
discussion, and be respectful to the instructor and fellow learners.
During lecture, new material will be introduced and discussed.  Also,
example problems will be solved which have the same character as those
on homework.  Participating in lectures are also the source of <b>bonus credit.</b> If you experience difficulty in lecture either understanding
or with the conduct of other students, see the instructor during
office hours or make an appointment.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">

<p>Readings from the textbook relevant to each lecture are listed in the
schedule.  You will increase your understanding of lectures by reading
associated textbook sections ahead of time, though this is not
assumed.  I may provide additional reading material to supplement the
textbook which will be posted on the course web page.

<div id="outline-container-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Homework: Programming Assignments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">

<p>Students will receive a number of programming assignments during the
semester.  Each assignment will involve writing programs and answering
questions about them to illustrate an understanding of course
material.  The programming assignments will be electronically
submitted to Blackboard on dates specified in the assignment by 11:59
p.m.  Students may submit assignments as many times as needed up to
the deadline.

<h3 id="sec-4-4"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Exams</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">

<p>There will be a series of hour-exams during the semester and a
mandatory final exam.  
</p>
<p>
On exam days, lecture will begin with a new topic, proceed to a brief
review.  After a short break, the exam will be administered.
</p>
<p>
All exams will be <b>open book, open notes, open computing devices</b> but
no network access will be allowed.  Exam questions will be designed
such that learning a concept on the fly will take too long.  Do not
let the availability of resources fool you into preparing for exams
inadequately.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>Performance will be evaluated using programming assignments, hour
exams, and the final exam.  Grading of assignments will be done by the
graduate teaching assistant.  Grading of exams will be done by the
lecturer.  Failure to complete an assignment or take an exam will
result only in loss of credit for that element of the course.  Six
assignments will be given but the lowest score will be dropped.

<p>Grading disputes on assignments should first be addressed to the
teaching assistant either in person or via e-mail.  Only if you are
unable to resolve the issue, then bring it to the instructor.  Grading
disputes on exams may be taken up with the instructor.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">

<p>Bonus credit will be awarded based on participation in class
discussions in lecture.  Each course meeting will be divided into two
halves.  Before each half, I will announce a range of the alphabet.
Students with last names in that range may elect to sit in the first 2
rows of the class and answer questions.  Reasonable effort on
answering questions in class will garner class participation credit.
Participation points may also earned for involvement in the class
discussion board such as giving suggestions to students with questions
(but not revealing answers wholesale).  The highest point winner at
the end of the semester will receive a 3% bonus to their overall
score in the course.  All other students will receive a bonus
proportional to the highest point winner.  For example, someone tied
with the highest point scorer will also receive a 3% bonus while
someone with half the participation points will receive a 1.5% bonus.

<p>Homework is due via electronic submission by 11:59 p.m. on the dates
specified.  <b>It is at the sole discretion of the instructor whether to accept late homeworks.</b> Health or family emergencies are usually
legitimate reasons for lateness but forgetfulness and procrastination
are not.  Notify the instructor via e-mail (preferred) or phone if you
know you will miss a HW.  In the case of an emergency, notify the
instructor as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Reductions in credit may be given in any case for late homework at the
discretion of the instructor.  Typically this will be on the order of
<b>10% reduction in credit per day late</b>.

<p><b>Missing an exam results in a zero score and make-up exams will be considered only in situations involving death and near death.</b>
</p>
<p>
Students are <b>required to take the final exam</b> though performance on
it impacts the overall grade only according to the below table.  The
final exam is scheduled for 7/25/2013 during the usual lecture
meeting.  The same criteria for missing exams will be applied for a
making up a missed final.  The final exam will consist of a
comprehensive set of questions covering all material covered in the
course.  Problems will be similar to those encountered on homework and
exams.

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Programming Policies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>Since this is a programming course, some special policies will be in
effect.
</p><ul>
<li>Programming projects will be submitted to Blackboard at the
  specified dates.  You may submit assignments to Blackboard as many
  times as you like: only the most recent submission will be graded
  (up to the deadline). 
</li>
<li>Back up your program regularly.  This is usually as simple as
  making a copy of the project folder. Submitting occasional early
  versions to Blackboard is also extremely helpful.  Should
  last-minute problems happen such as accidental deletion, you will at
  least have some of your work to show.  No code to submit means no
  credit.
</li>
<li>Submitted code that does not compile will receive little to no
  credit. 
</li>
<li>When test cases are provided by the instructor use them and make
  sure your code passes all tests.
</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how plagiarism works with programming in
  the next section of the syllabus.
</li>
<li>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission. It is
  important that you not touch your programs once you have made your
  final submission. If there are any submission problems,
  consideration for credit will only be given if it can be verified
  that the programs were not changed after being submitted.
</li>
<li>You may develop programs using any computer system available.
  However, submitted projects must run under the gcc compiler
  available on either Zeus or Mason.  No extensions will be given due
  to compiler incompatibilities.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Academic Honesty and Collaboration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">


<p>
<b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions.</b>
</p>
<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
<b>PRIME DIRECTIVE.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  More specific guidelines are given below.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-1"><span class="section-number-3">7.1</span> Thou Shalt Not</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">

<p>For the purposes of this course, the following actions constitute
scholastic misconduct (cheating):
</p><ul>
<li>Directly copying someone else's solution to a homework problem,
  including student solutions from a previous semester
</li>
<li>Directly copying an answer from some outside source such as the
  Internet or friend for a homework problem
</li>
<li>Making use of an Instructor Solution manual to complete homework
  problems

<li>Paying someone for a homework solution
</li>
<li>Posting solutions to our discussion board or any other web site
</li>
<li>Collaborating or copying someone else's answer during an exam

<h3 id="sec-7-2"><span class="section-number-3">7.2</span> Penalties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">

<p>Any instance of misconduct that is detected will be referred to the
honor board and will likely result in failing the course.  Be advised
that the teaching team will be employing <b>electronic means to detect plagiarism</b>.  This is extremely easy with computer code so keep your
nose clean.

<div id="outline-container-7-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-3"><span class="section-number-3">7.3</span> Fair Collaboration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">

<p>The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Talking to other students in the course about HW problems and
  informally describing how a problem may be solved.
<ul>
<li>Be <b>very careful</b> as you do this that you do not share any sort of
    code as this will be detected.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Getting or giving help fixing a small bug or two: a second set
  of eyes is a great boon to finding that misplaced semicolon that is
  preventing your code from compiling.
</li>
<li>Searching the Internet for alternative presentations of a
  programming concept.  
</li>
<li>When unsure whether collaboration is fair or not, stop the activity
  until it can be cleared with instructor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>At all times keep the <b>PRIME DIRECTIVE</b> in mind when studying with
another student.  The above collaborations should be limited to
getting someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish
line.
</p>
<p>
About half your grade will depend on programming projects.  Doing them
individually prepares you for the exams in which no collaboration of
any kind is allowed.

<div id="outline-container-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Guidelines for Success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">

<ul>
<li>Most homework problems have analogs that are (1) discussed in
  lecture or (2) described in an example problem in the textbook.
  This should encourage you to
<ul>
<li>Attend lecture and take notes
</li>
<li>Read the content of each section of the textbook carefully
</li>
<li>Analyze the example code distributed by the instructor
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Seek help from the instructor or teaching assistant when a
  concept is unclear.  If you blow a problem on a HW or exam and don't
  see why, attend office hours to ask about it.  We are here to aid
  your learning process.
</li>
<li>Form good habits early on.  This is a summer class so we will go at
  <b>twice the speed</b> of a regular semester.  To help you absorb that
  much information, it will be very useful to read some of the
  material ahead of time.  Things will move <b>fast</b> so don't fall
  behind.
</li>
<li>C Programming has been around for a long time and there is a wealth
  of information on it online.  Don't be afraid to consult online
  tutorials if a particular aspect of C programming is troublesome for
  you.  However, <b>do not</b> misuse to the Internet to obtain solutions
  that you don't understand.  Follow the <b>PRIME DIRECTIVE</b> at all
  times. 
</li>
<li>In addition to online resources, a number of alternative textbooks
