    <b>Course Description:</b> This course provides a baseline knowledge of
    technical and social issues at the heart of computer science. No prior
    knowledge of computing or programming is required. Students will develop a
    basic understanding of simple algorithms, information representation, and
    styles of problem solving which significantly affect computer science. They
    will gain practical experience working with a Unix-like operating system.
    Data security will be discussed to ensure safe communication. Students will
    gain exposure to basic software development tools such as version control
    and text editors. A variety of social and ethical issues will be discussed
    throughout the course including the impact of computing on society.
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
      <p>This course is required for all computer science students and serves as
        an opportunity for students to be introduced to GMU Computer Science
        Department policies. Freshmen and transfer students are expected to take
        the course in their first year in order to ensure that all CS students
        have exposure to certain essential tools and topics early on to enable
        their use in subsequent classes.</p>
    </div>
    <b>Prerequisite:</b> None. (However, enrollment in the course is limited to
    students in the BS in Computer Science or BS in Applied Computer Science
    programs.)<br>
    <br>
    <hr><br>
    <b>Learning Outcomes:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Students will understand many of the key ethical, legal and
            social issues related to information technology and how to interpret
            and comply with ethical principles, laws, regulations, and
            institutional policies.</i></b>&nbsp; This will be met through class
        discussions related to ethical theories and social implications of
        current computing trends such as Artificial Intelligence, Software
        Reliability and Social Media. Several class assignments will also
        address these topics.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will understand the essential issues related to
            information security, how to take precautions and use techniques and
            tools to defend against computer crimes.</b></i> This outcome will
        be met by class lectures on encryption, student use of secure
        communication channels (i.e. Virtual Private Networks), and an
        assignment on the modification of software security settings.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will understand the requirements of the Computer
            Science Major at GMU and have an appreciation of Computer Science as
            a discipline. </b></i>This will be met with lectures on the
        requirements for the CS major, as well as assignments that teach about
        the history of computer science and the people who influenced its
        progress. </li>
      <li><i><b>Students will have a basic understanding of the Unix operating
            system and how computers convey, store, and manipulate information,
            including binary representation of numbers and ASCII encoding of
            characters.&nbsp;</b></i> This will be met through class lectures
        and assignments that assess the students' understanding of Unix, binary
        numerical operations, ASCII representation of text, and logical
        operations.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will learn techniques for general problem solving and
            dividing complex problems into manageable component parts.</b></i>
        This will be met through class lectures that discuss various factors
        that hinder one's ability to find solutions to problems, puzzle solving
        techniques, and exercises that teach students how to break down the
        steps necessary to create solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr><br>
    <b>Late Assignments: </b>Assignments turned in after the due date will be
    penalized 10 percent per day (incl. weekend days/holidays). Since late work
    can cause major penalties, start work early! If your assignment isn't the
    way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near, submit it anyway for
    partial credit. <b>In fact, submit early and often! </b> The Blackboard
    system permits you to retrieve and resubmit your assignment until the due
    date, so you may resubmit if you improve your assignment prior to the
    deadline. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Prior approval by
      your TA is required in order to resubmit an assignment after the deadline,
      since s/he may have already graded your assignment.</span> If you know
    that you wish to resubmit a new version after the deadline, it is your
    responsibility to notify your TA no later than the time of the deadline, so
    s/he will not grade the on-time submission. <b>No resubmissions may be made
      after an assignment has been graded.</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Class Communications: &nbsp;</b>CS 110 will use Blackboard (including
    email sent via Blackboard) for most class communications. Piazza may also be
    used to clarify assignment requirements or other questions. You are
    encouraged to check piazza regularly, and you are responsible for any
    notifications or information posted on Blackboard either by your instructor,
    your GTA or the class UTA(s), and you will need to check the system
    regularly for such notices. Some information may be disseminated through
    class instead of BB, so you should always take note of in-class
    announcements.&nbsp; If you have individual questions or grading concerns,
    you should address those directly with your professor, either in person or
    via your gmu email account, NOT through piazza posts. When you email, please
    be sure to include your name, the class and section numbers, and the
    relevant topic in the subject header. (E.g.: Subject: My Name / CS 110-001 /
    Homework 2)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Accommodations:</span>&nbsp; If you
    are a student with a disability, please see your instructor and contact the
    Office of Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. All academic
    accommodations <b><span style="font-style: italic;">must</span></b> be
    arranged in advance through the ODS: http://ods.gmu.edu<br>
    <br>
    <b>Absences and Participation Credit:</b>&nbsp; You are expected to attend
    all scheduled class sessions. In the event of an emergency or health
    concern, please contact your professor as soon as possible. We will do our
    best to consider any special circumstances, but only if they are
    communicated in a timely manner, preferably in advance. Note that
    documentation may be required to support your absence.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Honor Code Policies:</span>&nbsp; All
    students are expected to abide by the course policies set forth here:
    https://stearnscenter.gmu.edu/home/gmu-common-course-policies/.&nbsp; Unless
    otherwise specified, all class-related assignments are to be individual
    efforts. Certain portions of group assignments may require individual
    efforts as well.&nbsp; Be careful to follow instructions regarding
    acceptable group efforts.&nbsp; Plagiarism is governed by the GMU Honor Code
    and will not be tolerated.&nbsp; Cheating on any assignment will be
    prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined
    in the GMU Honor Code. Sharing, collaboration, or looking at others'
    assignments is considered cheating. Review the university honor code.&nbsp;
    If you ever have a question about the Honor Code or instructor policies,
    ASK! We welcome the opportunity to help you understand our policies.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the Computer Science Department also has its own mandatory <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Honor Code</a> that provides more specific instructions regarding CS
    classes. Make sure you read and familiarize yourself with these rules.<br>
