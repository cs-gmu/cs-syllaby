      <span class="section">Policies</span><p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
            Challenging of grades (GTAs for homework/code; Professor for exams) must occur within a week of the grade being posted to Blackboard.
        </li>
		<li>
		    Use email when asking about grading or logistical issues; use the Piazza board when asking course content or assignment-related questions.
		</li>
		<li>
		    Make-up exams are only offered in response to university-accepted exceptional circumstances.
		</li>
		<li>
		    Late work is not accepted without prior arrangement or university-accepted emergency situation; computer failure is not considered an excuse, so please take steps to make backups.
		</li>
		<li>
		    Code-based assignments which do not compile will receive a low grade, likely a zero.
		<li>
		    Classwork (assignments and exams) is individual unless otherwise specified; sharing of work will be considered a violation of the Honor Code, and confirmed cheating will almost certainly result in an F in the course (see below).
		</li>
      </ul>
        
      <span class="section">Honor Code</span><p>
      Graded work in this class is individual unless otherwise specified on an assignment. Any direct 
      contribution on an exam or assignment will 
      be treated as a violation of George Mason's <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code">
      Honor Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Department Honor Code</a>, and will typically result in failing the class.</p><p>
	  
	  Some kinds of participation in third-party online study sites violate the GMU Honor code: these include accessing exam questions for this class which have been uploaded by others; accessing exam or assignment answers for this class; uploading of any of the instructor's materials or exams; and uploading any of your own answers or finished work.  It is <b>your resposibility</b> to protect your work, including protecting your computer with a password and avoiding sites which make your work publicly visible. Always consult with the professor before using these sites.</p><p>
	  
	  Please respect the importance of upholding the Honor Code, since it affects the meaningfulness of your degree and the degrees of other students. As a practical matter, an understanding of algorithms has a strong potential to impact your ability to land a job and perform well in your future careers; you put yourself in the best position to gain that understanding when you rely on your own work.</p><p>

      <span class="section">Privacy statment</span><p>
	  All course materials posted to Blackboard or other course site are private to this class; by federal law, 
	  any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice, or image) must not be shared with 
	  anyone not enrolled in this class.
	  In the event that any class meetings need to be held synchronously online, those classes will be recorded 
	  to provide necessary information for 
	  students in this class. Recordings will be stored on Blackboard and will only 
	  be accessible to students taking this course during this semester.</p><p>

      <span class="section">Disability accomodations</span><p>
	  Disability Services at George Mason University is committed to providing equitable access 
	  to learning opportunities for all students by upholding the laws that ensure equal treatment 
	  of people with disabilities. Students seeking accommodations for this class, please first 
	  visit <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu/">Disability Services</a> (<a href="mailto:ods@gmu.edu">ods@gmu.edu</a>; 
	  703-993-2474) for detailed information about the 
	  Disability Services registration process. Then please discuss the approved accommodations with 
	  the instructor.  The Disability Services office can be found in Student Union Building I (SUB I), 
	  Suite 2500.<br>
	  </p><p>

      <span class="section">Diversity and inclusion</span><p>
	  George Mason University <a href="https://integrative.gmu.edu/about/diversity">promotes a diverse, 
	  inclusive, and anti-racist environment</a>, under the belief 
	  that a just and equitable learning environment is a strong learning environment.  Students are valued
	  as individuals, irrespective of differences in race, ethnicity, national origin, first language, 
	  economic status, gender, gender expression and identity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or age.
	  As an important member of the GMU community, the Department of Computer Science is integral to the goal
	  of cultivating an environemnt which is committed to inclusion and anti-racism.</p><p>
	  
	  Students who prefer to be addressed by a specific name or gender pronouns should share this information
	  with the instructor (he/him).  Additionally, name and pronouns can be 
	  <a href="https://registrar.gmu.edu/updating-chosen-name-pronouns/">changed in the GMU records</a>. 
	  </p><p>
	  
      <span class="section">Title IX</span><p>
	  As a faculty member and designated "Responsible Employee," the instructor is required to 
	  <a href="https://diversity.gmu.edu/sexual-misconduct">report all</a> disclosures of sexual assault, 
	  interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason's Title IX Coordinator, per 
	  <a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/reporting-of-clery-act-crimes-andor-prohibited-sexual-conduct/">university policy 1412</a>.  
	  Students who wish to speak with someone confidentially, should contact the
	  <a href="https://ssac.gmu.edu/">Student Support and Advocacy Center</a> 
	  (<a href="mailto:ssac@gmu.edu">ssac@gmu.edu</a>; 703-993-3686) or 
	  <a href="https://caps.gmu.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> 
	  (<a href="mailto:caps@gmu.edu">caps@gmu.edu</a>; 703-993-2380).  Assistance may also be sought
	  from GMU's Title IX Coordinator (<a href="mailto:titleix@gmu.edu">titleix@gmu.edu</a>; 703-993-8730).
