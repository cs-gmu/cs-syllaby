          <h3>
          General Description and Preliminary List of Topics
          </h3>
Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information in large data repositories. The course covers key concepts and algorithms at the core of data mining.

        <p>
        Topics include: classification, clustering, association analysis, anomaly detection.


     <h3>Grading</h3>
     Assignments: 40% <br>
     Midterm + Final: 55% (highest score counts 30%; lowest score counts 25%) <br>
     Class activities and participation: 5% <br>
     Extra credit: competition winners for homework <br>
     <p>
     <b>Exams</b>: All exams are closed-book, and they must be taken at the scheduled time and place, unless prior arrangement has been made with the instructor. Missed exams cannot be made up.
     <p>
       <b>Assignments</b>: There will be 4-5 competition-style programming assignments. The preferred programming language is Python. Competition winners will get 1% extra credit added to the final grade. No late submission will be accepted.

<h3>Honor Code Statement</h3>
The  
<a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a> is in effect at all times. In addition, the CS department has its own <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">Honor Code policies</a> regarding programming assignments. Any deviation from the GMU or the CS department Honor Code is considered a Honor Code violation. 

<h3>Disabilities</h3>
If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the 
<a href="https://ds.gmu.edu/">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.
