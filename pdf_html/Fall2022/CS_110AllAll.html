    <p><b>Computing Resources:</b>&nbsp; Technology requirements necessary to
      successfully complete this class include a computer where you have the
      ability to install software and that has Internet sufficient to access
      Blackboard class materials, and to attend any synchronous classes
      virtually through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. A working microphone and
      webcam may be necessary to allow full participation in class activities.</p>

    <b>Course Description:</b> This course provides a baseline knowledge of
    technical and social issues at the heart of computer science. No prior
    knowledge of computing or programming is assumed. Students will develop a
    basic understanding of simple algorithms, information representation, and
    styles of problem solving which strongly affect computer science. They will
    gain practical experience working with a Unix-like operating system. Data
    security will be discussed to ensure safe communication. Students will gain
    exposure to basic software development tools such as version control, text
    editors, and shell scripting. A variety of social and ethical issues will be
    discussed throughout the course including information ownership and the
    impact of computing on society.
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
      <p>This course is required for all computer science students and serves as
        an opportunity for students to be introduced to Computer Science
        Department policies. Freshmen and transfer students are required to take
        the course in order to ensure that all CS students have exposure to
        certain essential tools and topics early on to enable their use in
        subsequent classes.</p>
    </div>
    <b>Prerequisite:</b> None. Enrollment in the course is limited to students
    in the BS in Computer Science or BS in Applied Computer Science programs.<br>
    <br>
    <hr><br>
    <b>Learning Outcomes:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Students will understand many of the key ethical, legal and
            social issues related to information technology and how to interpret
            and comply with ethical principles, laws, regulations, and
            institutional policies.</i></b>&nbsp; This will be met through class
        discussions related to ethical theories and social implications of
        current computing trends such as Artificial Intelligence, Software
        Reliability and Social Media. Several class assignments will also
        address these topics.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will understand the essential issues related to
            information security, how to take precautions and use techniques and
            tools to defend against computer crimes.</b></i> This outcome will
        be met by class lectures on encryption, student use of secure
        communication channels (i.e. Virtual Private Networks), and an
        assignment on the modification of software security settings.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will understand the requirements of the Computer
            Science Major at GMU and have an appreciation of Computer Science as
            a discipline. </b></i>This will be met with lectures on the
        requirements for the CS major, as well as assignments that teach about
        the history of computer science and the people who influenced its
        progress. </li>
      <li><i><b>Students will have a basic understanding of the Unix operating
            system and how computers convey, store, and manipulate information,
            including binary representation of numbers and ASCII encoding of
            characters.&nbsp;</b></i> This will be met through class lectures
        and assignments that assess the students' understanding of Unix, binary
        numerical operations, ASCII representation of text, and logical
        operations.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will learn techniques for general problem solving and
            dividing complex problems into manageable component parts.</b></i>
        This will be met through class lectures that discuss various factors
        that hinder one's ability to find solutions to problems, puzzle solving
        techniques, and exercises that teach students how to break down the
        steps necessary to create solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>In addition, in order to receive a passing grade in this class, each
      student will also meet at least once with an academic advisor in the CS
      Department during the semester for the purposes of course planning for
      following semesters.</b><br>

    <hr><br>
    <b>Late Assignments: </b>Assignments turned in after the due date will be
    penalized up to 10 percent per day (incl. weekend days/holidays). You should
    recognize that late work can cause major penalties, so start work early! If
    your assignment isn't the way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near,
    submit it anyway for partial credit. <b>In fact, submit early and often! </b>
    The Blackboard system permits you to retrieve and resubmit your assignment
    until the due date, so you may resubmit if you improve your assignment prior
    to the deadline. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resubmissions
      after the deadline require approval of your TA</span> (s/he may already
    have graded your assignment). If you know that you wish to resubmit a new
    version after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your TA no
    later than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time
    submission. <b>No resubmissions may be made after an assignment has been
      graded.</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Class Communications: &nbsp;</b>CS 110 will be using Piazza and
    Blackboard (including email sent via Blackboard) for most class
    communications. You are responsible for any notifications or information
    posted on Blackboard/Piazza either by your instructor, your GTA or the class
    UTA(s), and you will need to check the systems regularly for such notices.
    Some information may be disseminated through these systems rather than in
    class. Individual communications with the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by
    email using your GMU email account. When you email, please be sure to
    include your name, the class number and the topic in the subject header.
    (E.g.: Subject: My Name / CS 110-003 / Homework 2)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Accommodations:</span>&nbsp; If you
    are a student with a disability, please see your instructor and contact the
    Office of Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. All academic
    accommodations <b><span style="font-style: italic;">must</span></b> be
    arranged through the ODS: http://ods.gmu.edu<br>
    <br>
    <b>Absences and Participation Credit:</b>&nbsp; Any absences from class for
    health or emergency reasons are excusable only if reasonable notice is
    provided, in advance if possible. Documentation may be required.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Honor Code Policies:</span>&nbsp; All
    students are expected to abide by the GMU Honor Code found at <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/">http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/</a>.
    This policy is rigorously enforced. Unless otherwise specified, all
    class-related assignments are to be individual efforts. Certain portions of
    group assignments may require individual efforts as well.&nbsp; Be careful
    to follow instructions regarding acceptable group efforts.&nbsp; Plagiarism
    is governed by the GMU Honor Code and will not be tolerated.&nbsp; Cheating
    on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification of the
    Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. Sharing, collaboration,
    or looking at any assignments that are not your own is considered cheating.
    Review the university honor code and present any questions regarding the
    policies to instructor.<br>
    <br>
    The computer science department has an additional, more restrictive <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Honor Code</a> that you are also subject to. Make sure you read and
    familiarize yourself with these rules.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Safe Return To Campus Statement: </b>All students taking courses with a
    face-to-face component are required to follow the university’s public health
    and safety precautions and procedures outlined on the university Safe Return
    to Campus webpage (<a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus">https://www2.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus</a>).<br>
