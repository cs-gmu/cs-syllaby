  <dt><b>Prerequisites </b></dt>
</dl>

<ul>

  <li>Formally: Grade of C
or better in CS 310 (Data Structures) and STAT 344 (Probability and
Statistics) or equivalent.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>More specifically: Programming experience in Python preferred.
Java or C will work as well, but the assignments will use the Python
framework. Students should be familiar with basic probability and
statistics concepts, and linear algebra. Please expect lots of
programming in all the assignments and class project.</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Course Outcomes</span><br>

<ul>

  <li>The ability to apply
computing principles, probability and statistics relevant to the data
mining discipline to analyze data.</li>
  <li>A thorough understanding
of model
programming with data mining tools, algorithms for estimation,
prediction, and pattern discovery.</li>
  <li>The ability to analyze a
problem,
identifying and defining the computing requirements appropriate to its
solution: data collection and preparation, functional requirements,
selection of models and prediction algorithms, software, and
performance evaluation.</li>
  <li>The ability to
understand
performance metrics used in the data mining field to interpret the
results of applying an algorithm or model, to compare methods and to
reach conclusions about data.</li>
  <li>The ability to
communicate
effectively to an audience the steps and results followed in solving a
data mining problem (through a term project)</li>
</ul>

  <dt> <b>Assignments</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be 4-5 competition-style programming assignments. The preferred
  programming language is Python. Competition winners will get 1%
  extra credit added to the final grade. No late submission will be accepted.</p>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Exams</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be quizzes throughout the semester covering lectures
  and readings, and one final exam. The final exam is
  comprehensive. All exams are closed-book, and they must be taken at the scheduled time and
place, unless prior arrangement has been made with the instructor.
Missed exams cannot be made up. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</p>
