			Homework will be submitted to Blackboard or GradeScope depending on the
			assignment. <b>Turning in the wrong files</b> will result in a zero
			(no exceptions). Any code for programming projects that <b>does not
			compile</b>, specifically on Java 1.9, will receive a zero (no exceptions,
			even if it is a "small fix"). It is your responsibility to verify your
			submissions.
			
			<b>Blackboard or GradeScope being unavailable</b> is not an excuse 
			for turning in a late assignment; in the rare situation that a website
			is somehow unavailable or giving an error, you MUST email your submission 
			to me before the deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.
			<b>Catastrophic computer failure</b> will not be cause for an extension. 
			Use a backup service to back up your work!
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Homework is considered individual</b> unless otherwise
			authorized by me. Therefore no sharing of code
			or solutons, and no discussion of problem solutions is
			allowed with anyone except the TAs or me. You may
			not use the internet to find, develop, or solicit help for
			code, assignments, or any other individual work.
			
			<b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
			a password, to not post your work to websites like Pastebin
			that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
			computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
			computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
			your work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Homework must be submitted on time and extensions require
			exceptional circumstances</b> (as judged by me) and must be
			arranged in advance. Extensions are never given <i>on or after</i>
			the due day unless you have a university-accepted emergency.
			GTAs cannot approve late submissions or extensions. Normal obligations
			such as family or friend events, vacations, or other classes are <i>not</i>
			exceptional circumstances (unless hospitals are involved).
			
			If you need an extension or miss a due date because of a
			university-accepted emergency (such as being taken to the
			hospital), you must notify me within 24 hours
			to make arrangements. You will be asked to provide documentation
			of the emergency and your involvement. Failure to follow these
			policies will result in a zero.
			I may elect to "exempt" a missed homework
			rather than give an extension under certain circumstances. In this case, the
			other homework in the same <i>sub</i>-category will gain more weight.
			
			Missing a homework due date for any non-university-accepted reason (such as 
			not paying attention to when the due date is), will result in a zero.

			All students must have their <b>GMU identification</b> available on

			<b>Early or late/makeup exams require exceptional circumstances</b>
			(as judged by me) and must be arranged in advance.
			Vacation plans are not exceptional circumstances.
			
			If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
			absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
			the exam), notify me within 24 hours of your absence 
			to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring approved documentation
			with you when you take the make-up exam.
			Failure to follow these policies will result in a zero. I may
			elect to replace a missed midterm with some (or all) of the final
			exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam under certain circumstances.

			in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,

			The computer science department has an <a

			Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our

			applies to programming and CS, what constitutes cheating in the
			CS setting. It clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
			sorts of assignments. Make sure you read and familiarize
			yourself with these rules.
		</li>
		<li>
			The CS Department take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
			copying or sharing code, solutions, algorithms, or other violations of the
			honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
			software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
			the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
			Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
			than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.
