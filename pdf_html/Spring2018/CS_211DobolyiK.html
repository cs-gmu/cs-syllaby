Instead, you will explore online videos, slides							and readings <b>before</b> coming to class, and we will practice programming together in class. (This is called the							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom" target="_blank">flipped classroom</a> model.)</li>						<li>We will have two types of programming assignments: practice and assessment. You can work on practice assignments							at any time. We encourage you to <b>work with your classmates</b> or anyone else that							can help, and use online resources that you can find. Practice assignments will not count towards your grade, but							will prepare you for assessments. When you are ready, you will schedule an assessment for your lab section, to be							taken in lab. These will be done individually on a lab computer, and you must score at least a 70% to pass each one. You are allowed to							try each assessment up to three times, though you may not repeat an assessment for a higher score once you've passed it.</li>						<li>This class is self-paced in the sense that <b>you can take assessments whenever you are ready</b>. You can complete							several assessments in the same week, or use several weeks to complete an assessment. You must finish all assessments/exams by the last day of finals. The dates established by the University 							for dropping and selective withdrawal remain the same for this course regardless of the class structure. Refer to Registrar calendar for dates.</li>						<li>If you are moving too slowly through the course, and in danger of failing it (at the professor's discretion), the professor may choose to schedule you for an assessment in person or by email. These assessments cannot be cancelled except by a documented university-approved excuse.</li>						<li><b>You must attend class to work on practice assignments</b> until you have completed all assessments. Attendance 							(while you still need to pass assessments) will be taken and is worth 10% of your overall grade. You may miss three classes without penalty.							An exception is that if you complete all assessments							before the end of the semester, you are automatically marked as attending all remaining class meetings (and should ignore the attendance scores/data on Blackboard after that point).</li>						<li>In an effort to encourage students to finish the course in a timely manner, any student that passes assessments 1 through 9 on or before April 25 will not have to take the final exam in the course.							We will use your average score across all assessments as your score on the final, plus 5% (so if you averaged 85% on all assessments, your score on the final will be a 90%, and you don't have to take it).							Additionally, any student who finishes the course before the last day of lecture will recieve a grade bump in their course (so a B+ to an A-, for example).</li>						<li>Students will spend time in lecture and lab engaging with instructors, TAs, and other students, and must behave in a civil and respectful manner at all times. Students that cannot maintain these standards will be asked to leave the room (and will not be offered a makeup assessment in a lab). Similarly, students must act respectfully in all discussion board and email exchanges.</li>					</ol>				</td>			</tr>					<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Discussion Board Use</strong>				</td>				<td>					All students will be enrolled in the discussion forum for CS 211 on <a href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</a>. You will receive a free					invitation to this resource via your Mason email. We will all use the discussion board throughout the semester to ask and					answer questions and to disseminate information. We will make every effort to answer questions within 24 hours, but					usually sooner (often two hours during adult working hours). The instructor reserves the right to make any post public, should it benefit the class.				</td>			</tr>										<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Practice Assignments</strong>				</td>				<td>					We offer several practice assignments to prepare for each assessment. Practice assignments should be done collaboratively; 					you can and should work on these assignments during class meetings (where the instructor and TA will be available), at home,					or with your classmates at any place and anytime. Although we will track how many practice assignments you are working on					and will complete, they will not be graded. If you are struggling with assessments, your best solution is to work more					practice assignments.				</td>			</tr>										<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Assessment Assignments</strong>				</td>				<td>					Labs will be offered weekly, and used for automated, online student assessments. Please <a href="./schedule.php">request an appointment for an assessment in lab</a>.					Students must attempt at least one assessment a week (until you've passed all assessments).<br>					<br>					All students must sign up for an assessment slot every week (until you've passed all 					assessments or you're ahead of the schedule below); if there is room, you will be allowed to take additional assessments each week on a first-come, 					first-served basis. Out of fairness to other students, you must show up for an assessment slot you schedule; failing to do 					so will count as failing that assessment (this way we can prevent a handful of students using up all assessment slots without 					showing up to take them). You may schedule one assessment per week, but you may take more assessments each week, assuming slots are available. In addition,					you may take as many assessments in an assessment slot as you like; if for some reason you already know python/programming 					and you want to finish this course in a week or two, this is entirely possible. We budget 45 minutes for each assessment, 					but you're free to do them faster, and if there are free assessment slots later in the day (you won't know these until the 					day-of, however), then you can stay later and take another assessment(s).<br>					<br>					Assessments will be graded in terms of percentage passing tests/questions. You must score at least a 70% to pass the assessment,					and you have up to three chances to pass each assessment. Only the highest scoring assessment will count towards your final					grade, and you may not make additional attempts after passing an assessment. All grading is automated so you will receive the					score the computer tells you, or you will submit a scantron. We will not grade any assignments by hand, however, we reserve the right to reduce the grade					on an assessment if we find evidence of soft-cheating (such as coding so that your answer only passes certain inputs)					or hard-cheating (such as copying off your neighbor during an assessment).				</td>			</tr>					<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Grading</strong>				</td>				<td>					Your final grade will be determined as follows:<br>					<br>						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10% for class participation<br>						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70% for the assessments<br>						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% for the final exam<br>						<br>					Practice assignments do not count towards your grade, and the class has no exams besides the final.<br>					<br>					<b>Please note that you must pass all assessments to pass the course with a C- or higher. If you pass all but one assessment, you will					receive a D in the course. Per departmental policy, you must pass the final with a 60% or higher to pass the course, unless your scores on all other assessments are 80% or higher.</b><br>					<br>					Final course grades are calculated as follows:<br>					<br>     				A+ (>= 98.0%) A (>= 92.0%) A&ndash; (>= 90.0%)<br>					B+ (>= 88.0%) B (>= 82.0%) B&ndash; (>= 80.0%)<br>     				C+ (>= 78.0%) C (>= 72.0%) C&ndash; (>= 70.0%)<br>					D  (>= 60.0%)<br>					F  (< 60.0%)<br>				</td>			</tr>						<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Honor Code</strong>				</td>				<td>					As with all Mason courses, CS 211 is governed by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.					<b>Practice assignments may be done collaboratively with any resources, so there are no honor code restrictions.</b>					However, <b>graded assessments carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the student.				</td>			</tr>				<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Office Hours</strong>				</td>				<td>					Office hours are times that I commit to being in my office, door open, first come, first served. You do not need an appointment,					and no appointments are made. If office hours are very busy, I will limit the amount of time I spend with each student to					try and see all students for at least a little bit. If you cannot make my office hours, then I will suggest you visit					the office hours of any of our TAs (unless it is a specific question a TA would be unable to answer, such as a course 					policy question not answered on the syllabus).				</td>			</tr>				<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Email Use</strong>				</td>				<td>					I occasionally send important announcements to your Mason email account, so please read it daily during weekdays. I also use Piazza to send important announcements through email.<br>					<br>					General class questions that might be useful or interesting to other students should be posted to the discussion board, not sent through email.				</td>			</tr>				<tr>				<td bgcolor=#CCCCCC>					<strong>Learning Disabilities</strong>				</td>				<td>					If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see the instructor and contact the					<a target="_blank" href="http://ods.gmu.edu/">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS).
