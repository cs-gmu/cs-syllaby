      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is assumed that students read the scheduled sections
          prior to each lecture.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.4 Software &amp; Programming Requirements<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> You will need a computer for this class with some modern
        operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember
        that lab computers are also available on campus, see campus
        resources below.</li>
      <li>The prerequisite for this course is C or better in CS 211. We
        will assume that you have developed a significant degree of
        skill in programming (program organization, coding, documenting,
        testing and debugging) -- you will develop yet more this
        semester. I will also assume that you are acquainted with basic
        complexity analysis ("big O") and are able to build abstract
        data types using Java classes.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.5 Discussion board: <b>Piazza</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Course schedule, announcements, lecture slides, assignments,
        discussion. GTA/UTA contacts and office hours will be on Piazza
        too. Sign up yourself by following this link: <a
          href="http:piazza.com/gmu/spring2018/cs310">http:piazza.com/gmu/spring2018/cs310</a><br>
      </li>
      <li><b>The discussion board on Piazza is required reading for all
          projects</b>. You MUST read the discussion board for
        clarifications and project updates.</li>
      <li>All instructors and TAs can view all material on Piazza.</li>
      <li>No sharing answers or code solutions to assignments on the
        discussion board. You can include code in private posts to the
        instructors (visible to all professors, GTAs, and UTAs). See
        Honor code section below for more details.</li>
      <li>Email course staff only for logistical issues such as meeting
        outside of office hours, missing lab/lecture, grading disputes,
        medical situations, etc. Email addresses are listed on Piazza.</li>
      <li>Do not e-mail course staff about programming problems; use the
        discussion board. <i>Project help questions sent via email are
          of extremely low priority, as they were sent to the wrong
          place.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>1.6 </b><a href="https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/"><b>Blackboard</b></a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Grades will be posted to Blackboard.</li>
      <li>Projects assignments will be submitted (per published
        deadlines) via Blackboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>1.7 Office hours</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Office hours are listed for all staff on Piazza under
        (Resources/Staff).&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Students must make significant, individual effort on all
        projects before coming to see a GTA/professor. Waiting until the
        last minute, in the expectations that the entire project will be
        explained in one office hours session, is not feasible.</li>
      <li>Office hours are often crowded - do not rely on them for last
        minute help, as we cannot guarantee that we will be able to
        spend significant time with every student. You can also use the
        discussion board for posting questions.</li>

    <h1>2. Course Description</h1>
    <h2>2.2 Course topics:</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211.
      Students will learn how to approach larger and more challenging
      programming problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a
      significant part of this course and students should expect to
      spend a good deal of time on the programming projects. The course
      also introduces a variety of data structures and illustrates the
      types of problems for which they are useful.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Tentative topics to be covered include:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generics and Collections</li>
      <li>Basic Complexity Analysis</li>
      <li>Linked Lists</li>
      <li>Stacks and Queues</li>
      <li>Simple and Balanced Binary Search Trees</li>
      <li>B-Trees and File Organization</li>
      <li>Hash Tables</li>
      <li>Graphs and Basic Graph Algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.2 Course Outcomes:</h2>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the semester, a passing student will be
    able to carry out the following types of activities:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Reinforce what they have learned about elementary data
        structures from CS 211.</li>
      <li>Extended their knowledge of data structures to more
        sophisticated data structures. This includes balanced binary
        search trees, B-trees and B+-trees, hashing, and basic graphs.</li>
      <li>Use generic types in their data structures.</li>
      <li>Do more demanding programming than they had in CS 211. All
        programming is done in Java. This involves more program design
        and debugging techniques.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>F (&lt; 60.0%)</li>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3.2 Programming assignments<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Students will receive a number of programming projects during the
      semester. These programming projects will be a primary focus of
      your grade - each one should take multiple sessions of coding,
      with questions asked in between. Don't be surprised if you're
      spending 20+ hours on each one. All project grades will be
      averaged together evenly. Programming projects are <b>INDIVIDUAL</b>
      work.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>All projects are to be submitted to Blackboard. You can
          submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
          and by default only the last version will be graded. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero. You
          can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that
          you turned in a working copy.</li>
        <li><b>Broken Code == Bad Scores</b>. Any code turned in that
          does not compile, specifically on Java 1.8 is likely to
          receive a zero. If the grader is able to quickly fix your
          code, you might get some points back. If the grader cannot
          immediately spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate to get
          any points at all.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Deadline</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Projects can be turned in <b>at most 48 hours</b> late, no
          exceptions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Each 24-hour period entered after the deadline lowers the
          maximum score by <b>25%</b> (not quite the same as a 25%
          penalty).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Each student gets <b>three</b> One-Late-Day tokens, which
          are automatically used by late submissions to avoid the 25%
          penalty; you still must turn in work within 48 hours of the
          original deadline, even if you use tokens! (note that you
          can't use three tokens on a single project)</li>
        <li>The last project might not be allowed to be turned in late,
          to facilitate end-of-semester grading.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Unused late-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a student's
          overall grade at the semester's end.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in
          a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
          somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the
          student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the
          deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
        <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
          extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
          service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
          it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
          stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
          forgot to (frequently) back up your work!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Honor code</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming projects are considered <b>individual</b>
          efforts, therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of
          problem solutions are allowed with anyone except the TAs or
          the professor. Student projects will be manually and
          automatically assessed for cheating. <br>
        </li>
        <li>You may not use any Internet resources to create code or
          algorithms, besides the textbooks, the slides, and Piazza,
          unless otherwise specified. However, you are free to look up
          the syntax errors your encounter online, to gain an
          understanding of what the syntax error means. The projects
          we're doing this semester can be directly solved using
          techniques discussed in class, and no outside material is
          needed unless otherwise noted.</li>
        <li><b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
          a password, to not post your code to websites like Pastebin
          that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
          computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
          computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
          your code. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>3.4 In-class participation: <a href="http://pytania.cs.gmu.edu">Pytania</a><br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a clicker-alternative required for class
        participation. Use your <font color="#ff6600">GMU email address</font>
        to sign up to <font color="#ff6600">your specific section</font>.
        Sign up here: <a href="http://pytania.cs.gmu.edu/">http://pytania.cs.gmu.edu/</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that attempting to answer questions from home is not
        permitted. Any or all of your class participation score may be
        forfeited if we catch you doing so.</li>
      <li>3% of semester total based on Pytania participation; up to <font
          color="#ff6600">1% extra credit</font> based on correctness.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> </h2>
    <h2>3.5 Exams </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by
        instructor. They will be entirely paper and pencil - no
        computers.</li>
      <li>All students must have their GMU identification available on
        testing days.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The final exam is cumulative. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances
        (as judged by me) and must be arranged in advance. Vacation
        plans are not exceptional circumstances.</li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero. We may also elect to allow the final exam to count the
        extra amount to give you a sort of do-over. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3.6 Contested Grades<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
        grader. For projects, that is your GTA. For exams, that is your
        professor.</li>
      <li>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested
        within one week of receiving the grade (on BlackBoard). No grade
        changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>4. <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font> <a
        name="honor_code"></a> </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> All students are expected to abide by the <a
          href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
        This policy is rigorously enforced. Cheating will be prosecuted
        and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined
        in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,
          collaboration, or looking at any code or algorithm for the
          programming projects that is not your own, including resources
          from Internet, is considered cheating</font>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The computer science department has an <a
          href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
          Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our
        course. The document helps you to understand how GMU honor code
        applies to programming and CS, what constitutes cheating in the
        CS setting. It clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
        sorts of assignments. Make sure you read and familiarize
        yourself with these rules. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
        copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
        honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
        software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
        the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
        Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
        than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. <b>Confirmed





          cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>5. Learning Disabilities</h1>
    Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented
    with GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability
      Services</a>) that may impact academic performance should speak
    with the professor ASAP to discuss appropriate accommodations. Even
    if you don't know whether you plan on utilizing the accommodations
    for any assignment/test, it's in your best interest to prepare and
    get documented ahead of time.<br>
