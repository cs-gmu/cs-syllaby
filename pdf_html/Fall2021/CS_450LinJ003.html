  <dd>
    <p> This course covers basics to intermediate knowledge for the
design, implementation, and use of relational database systems. The
main topics include the relational data model, Entity-Relationship (ER)
model for database design, Relational Algebra, SQL, database
programming, functional dependencies and normalization, and indexing.
Students will practice to design, develop, and implement a relational
ORACLE database and use the database for queries, transaction
processing, and report generation.</p>
