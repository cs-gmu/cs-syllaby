      <li>Syntax analysis - grammars, LL(1) parsers, LR(1) parsers</li>
      <li>Semantic processing</li>
      <li>Code generation</li>
      <li>Code optimization </li>
    </ul>

    <p> <b>2.2 Projects</b><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All projects must be done on an individual basis unless stated
        otherwise.</li>
      <li>All project grades are normalized and each contributes to your
        final grade evenly. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Incorrect/broken submissions:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Code that doesn't compile/run will likely get a very low
          score. It specifically MUST compile/run on <b>zeus.vse.gmu.edu</b>.</li>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files or corrupted files will likely
          result in a zero.</li>
        <li>
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          If you turn in the wrong files, the ONLY way you MIGHT receive
          credit is by showing your professor a backup where the
          modified date on the files is<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>outside of
            your control</b>. Modified dates on personal computers
          and/or public computers are<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>NEVER</i><span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>accepted as proof
          of work. Backups which WILL ALWAYS be considered are: backup
          copy on zeus; prior submissions to Gradescope; or emails to
          your Professor/GTA. Backups which MIGHT be accepted include:
          emails from your GMU email to yourself, uploading to certain
          backup services (such as GoogleDrive or a private GitHub
          repo), and uploads to the discussion forum.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>: </font>
        <ul>
          <li>Up to <b>48</b> hours late work accepted. Each day late
            drops the highest possible score by 25%.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Each student gets <b>two</b> "Emergency Day" tokens,
            which are <i>automatically</i> used by late submissions to
            avoid the 25% penalty. <br>
          </li>
          <li>Unused emergency-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a
            student's overall grade at the semester's end.</li>
          <li>Blackboard/Gradescope being unavailable is not an excuse
            for turning in a late assignment; in the rare situation that
            the website is somehow unavailable or giving the student an
            error, the student MUST email their submission to their GTA
            before the deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
          <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
            extension. Use a backup service such as OneDrive (or any
            cloud service), emailing yourself, making multiple rounds of
            submissions to Blackboard/Gradescope, whatever it takes. <br>

    <h2>2.3 Quizzes<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be weekly online quizzes for most of the weeks.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</li>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>:</font> <b>no late
          submission</b> accepted for quizzes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.4 Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Midterm and final exams will be administered online.&nbsp;
        Details will be announced ahead of the exams.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances
        (as judged by the professor) and must be arranged in advance.
        Vacation plans are not exceptional circumstances.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero. We may elect to allow the final exam to count the extra
        amount to give you a sort of do-over; we also reserve the right
        to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written. </li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.5 Discussion board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, Piazza,
        to ask and answer questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>No sharing answers to homework assignments on the discussion
        board.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Under no circumstances should your code of assignments be
        posted publicly to the discussion board. Students can post
        questions and code privately, although the instructor reserves
        the right to make any post public, so that other students can
        see the responses. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.6 Other<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Contested Grades</b>: Contesting of grades on any/all
        submissions must be requested within one week of receiving the
        grade. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that
        deadline.</li>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.<br>
      </li>
      <li>IN (Incomplete) policy as indicated in the catalog will be
        strictly adhered to. You must provide the necessary back-up
        documentation (e.g. medical certificate) for your application to
        be considered favorably. In all circumstances, the written
        request, with all the back up documentation, must be received
        before the final exam week.</li>

    </h1>
    <h1>3 Policies</h1>
    <h2>3.1&nbsp;<font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All students are expected to abide by the <a
          href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
        This policy is rigorously enforced. The computer science
        department has an <a
          href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
          Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our
        course<b>.&nbsp; </b>Cheating on any assignment will be
        prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee
        as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,

          collaboration, or looking at any code, algorithm, or solutions
          of assignments that is not your own (or outside the group for
          group assignments), including resources from Internet, is
          considered cheating</font>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
        copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
        honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
        software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
        the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
        Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
        than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. <b>Confirmed

          cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3.2 Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> All course materials posted to Blackboard or other course
        sites are private; by federal law, any materials that identify
        specific students (via their name, voice, or image) must not be
        shared with anyone not enrolled in this class. </li>
      <li> Video recordings of class meetings that include audio or
        visual information from other students are private and must not
        be shared. </li>
      <li> Live Video Conference Meetings (e.g. Collaborate or Zoom)
        that include audio or visual information from other students
        must be viewed privately and not shared with others. </li>
