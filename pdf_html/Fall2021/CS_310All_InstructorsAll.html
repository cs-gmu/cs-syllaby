	<div class="hidden" id="2.1">
	<p>
		CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211.
		Students will learn how to approach larger and more challenging
		programming problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a
		significant part of this course and students should expect to
		spend a good deal of time on the programming projects. The course
		also introduces a variety of data structures and illustrates the
		types of problems for which they are useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tentative topics to be covered include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lists, Stacks, and Queues</li>
		<li>Hash Tables and Hashing</li>
		<li>Trees and Basic Tree Algorithms</li>
		<li>Graphs and Basic Graph Algorithms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		See the schedule available on Piazza (under Resources) for a
		more detailed topics list.

	<div class="hidden" id="2.2">
	<p>
		In CS310, students will:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Gain an ability to analyze the runtime efficiency of
			algorithms that create and manipulate data structures.
		</li>
		<li>
			Gain an ability to compare data structure trade-offs
			such that the student is able to choose appropriate
			implementations for a given data structure and appropriate
			data structures for a given application.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reinforce their knowledge of basic data structures
			(linked lists, dynamic array lists, stacks, and queues)
			and extend their knowledge to more sophisticated data
			structures, including hash tables, balanced trees,
			priority queues, and basic graphs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Implement and use learned data structures to solve real
			computing problems. This includes substantial reinforcement
			of language-specific techniques for abstract data types
			and design and debugging techniques.

	<p>
		Students will receive a number of programming projects during the
		semester (typically four). These programming projects will be a
		primary focus of your grade - each one should take multiple sessions
		of coding, with questions asked in between. Don't be surprised if
		you're spending 20+ hours on each one. Programming projects are
		<b>INDIVIDUAL</b> work.
	</p>
	<p>
		All projects numbered <b>above 0</b> will be averaged together evenly.
		If there is a Project 0 (some professors/semesters have this), it
		will not be part of the calculation, but instead act as a "flag".
		If you do not pass Project 0 you will not receive credit for any project
		until you do (infinite resubmissions for Project 0 will be allowed).
		At the time of the last submission deadline for Project 0 (see schedule),
		if you still have not passed Project 0, your project grades will be
		replaced with a 0s.

			All projects are to be submitted to Blackboard. You can
			submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
			and by default only the last version will be graded.
		</li>
		<li>
			Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero. You
			can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that
			you turned in a working copy.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you turn in the wrong files, the ONLY way you MIGHT receive
			credit is by showing your professor a backup where the modified
			date on the files is <b>outside of your control</b>. Modified 
			dates on personal computers and/or public computers are <i>NEVER</i>
			accepted as proof of work. Backups which WILL ALWAYS be considered
			are: prior submissions to Blackboard or emails to your Professor/GTA.
			Backups which MIGHT be accepted include: emails from your GMU email
			to yourself, uploading to certain backup services (such as
			GoogleDrive or a private GitHub repo), and uploads to the discussion
			forum.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Broken Code == Bad Scores</b>. Any code turned in that
			does not compile, specifically on Java 1.9 will receive a zero.
			If the grader is able to quickly fix your code, you might get
			<i>some</i> points back, and you'll be fortunate to get any at all.

	<div class="hidden" id="3.2.2">
	<ul>
		<li>
			Projects can be turned in <b>at most 24 hours</b> late, no
			exceptions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Submitting a project after the deadline lowers the maximum
			score by <b>25%</b> (not quite the same as a 25% penalty). One minute
			late is the same as 23 hours and 59 minutes late.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each student gets <b>TWO</b> "Emergency" tokens, which
			are automatically used by late submissions to avoid
			the 25% penalty; you still must turn in work within 24 hours
			of the original deadline, even if you use tokens!
		</li>
		<li>
			Unused emergency-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a student's
			overall grade at the semester's end.
		</li>
		<li>
			Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in
			a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
			somehow unavailable or giving an error, you MUST email your
			submission to your GTA (and CC your professor) before the
			deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.
		</li>
		<li>
			Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
			extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
			service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
			it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
			stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
			forgot to (frequently) back up your work!

			Due to the size of the class, individual professors and graders cannot
			support students with injuries or disabilities on an ad-hoc basis.
			We ask that all accommodations for such conditions be arranged through
			GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Disability Services</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Students with a physical or learning disability which is <b>already
			documented with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Disability
			Services</a>)</b> should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
			their approved accommodations. Even if you don't know whether you plan
			on utilizing the accommodations for any assignment/test, you need to
			make sure you and your professor are working together from the beginning
			of the semester to ensure your success in the class.
		</li>
		<li>
			Students with a physical or learning disability who have <b>not yet registered
			with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Disability Services</a></b>
			should register with that office as soon as possible. Even if you don't
			know whether you'll need to utilize the accommodations, it's in your
			best interest to prepare ahead of time and get your condition documented
			as accommodations are not retroactive. They have a quick and easy registration
			process. All you need is documentation for your condition.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Disability Services</a>
			also <b>handles services for many temporary disabilities</b> (for example,
			if you break your arm, they can arrange note taking services).
			Please contact them if you discover any sudden impairment that affects
			your ability to function in class and/or on your projects. They have
			a quick and easy registration process. All you need is documentation
			for your condition.
