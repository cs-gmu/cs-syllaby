			Homework must be submitted in person unless you have a

		<li>
			Homework will be submitted and returned in class.
			Grades will be also be posted to Blackboard for tracking.
			Please report any issues with grades on Blackboard within

		</li>
		<li>
			Homework is considered <b>individual</b> unless otherwise

			not use the internet to find, develop, or solicit help for

			The computer science department has an <a

			Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our

			CS setting. It clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
			sorts of assignments. Make sure you read and familiarize
			yourself with these rules.
		</li>
		<li>
			The CS Department take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
			copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
			honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
			software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
			the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
			Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
			than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.
			<b>Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course
			failure.</b>

		</li>
		<li>
			Students with a physical or learning disability which is <b>already
			documented with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Disability

			their approved accommodations. Even if you don't know whether you plan

			Students with a physical or learning disability who have <b>not yet registered
