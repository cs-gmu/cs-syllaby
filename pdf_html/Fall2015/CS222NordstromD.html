<h3><font size="+1" face="serif">Textbook</font></h3>
<p>
<font size="+1" face="serif">
The text is Hanly and Koffman, Problem Solving and Program Design in C, 7 <sup>th</sup> ed.,
Pearson, 2013.

</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="serif">The Course</font></h3>
<font size="+1" face="serif">The prerequisite is C or better in CS 112.  I will assume
that you have a basic understanding of the elements of programming in
some high level language. The course
will be taught using C.  This is a terminal course in programming for
engineers and we will look at some aspects of the C 
language and programming issues with which engineers should be
familiar.
</font><p></p>

<h3><font size="+1" face="serif">Topics</font></h3>

<font size="+1" face="serif">Topics include:
</font><ul>
<font size="+1" face="serif"><li>Structure of a C program</li>
<li>Preprocessor directives</li>
<li>Basic data types</li>
<li>Pointers</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>String handling</li>
<li>Sorting</li>
<li>More pointers</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Bitwise operators and operations</li>
<li>Low-level programming ideas</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
</font></ul><font size="+1" face="serif"> 

</font><p>
<font size="+1" face="serif">If time permits we may discuss pointers some more.
</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1" face="serif">Programs</font></h3>

<p>
<font size="+1" face="serif">There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website</font></p>

<p>
<font size="+1" face="serif"> You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies" name="[http://cs.gmu.edu/studtents/honor-code.html]">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>,
and the University honor code: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/
</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</font></p>

<p>
<font size="+1" face="serif">You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate ate my program" are <i>not</i>
reasons for late submissions).
</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1" face="serif">Grading</font></h3>

<p>
<font size="+1" face="serif">There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</font></p>



<ul>
<font size="+1" face="serif"><font size="+1" face="serif"><li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</font></font></ul><font size="+1" face="serif">
