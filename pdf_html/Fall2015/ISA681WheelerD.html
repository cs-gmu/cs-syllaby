<h1>Syllabus for SWE 681 / ISA 681 - Fall 2015</h1>

<!--
<p>
<i>As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. - Maurice Wilkes (1949)<br><br></font></i>
-->

<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
GMU Catalog:
&#8220;Theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular
on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows,
race conditions and random number generation, and on identification of
potential threats and vulnerabilities early in design cycle. Emphasizes
methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security
vulnerabilities, techniques to prove absence of vulnerabilities, ways
to avoid security holes in new software, and essential guidelines for
building secure software: how to design software with security in mind
from the ground up and integrate analysis and risk management throughout
the software life cycle.&#8221;

<p>
People around the world now depend vitally on computers for their health
and well-being.
Unfortunately, this software can often be exploited by attackers,
resulting in terrible harm.
This class will study how to develop software that is far more
resistant to attack.
This includes how to prevent many vulnerabilities
from being in the software in the first place.
We will also discuss detecting break-ins when they do occur,
containing their impact, and responding to them.
The goal of the class is to prepare you to be able to develop software
that is far more secure, and to
prepare you to help others do the same.

<p>
This classes focuses on defense, not on attack.
We&#8217;ll discuss attack to some extent, but only enough to help us understand
how to defend.
Most software security problem stem from the same small set of types of
vulnerabilities (aka weaknesses),
so we will spend a lot of time learning about these common weaknesses
and how to counter them.
We will also cover general designs and techniques
for securing software designs and implementations in general, so
this is class is <i>not</i> just an enumeration of common mistakes.

<p>
This is an extremely <i>practical</i> class.
We <i>will</i> cover theory and principles,
but we will also cover many practical specifics
so you can <i>apply</i> these principles in the real world.
If you cannot <i>apply</i> the theory, then
you understand neither the theory nor the practice.
What&#8217;s more, I want you to have experience in
trying to convince others to
<i>change</i> their behavior; that is absolutely necessary
to get more secure software worldwide.

<p>
Most students report that this class has above-average workload.
There is a <i>lot</i> of reading (because there is a lot of material
to cover), a topic paper/presentation,
and final group programming project.
None of it is busywork, though; it all has a purpose.
Most past students have said that although this class is
a lot of work, they were glad they took it;
I hope you will be able to say the same.

<p>
I may add a few additional required reading articles as we go.

<p>
You are also responsible for learning the materials in the class
presentations by me.
I make most of the presentations publicly available at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-class/">http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-class/</a>, and when I am about to present them, I copy that
into the Blackboard site.
I routinely update the presentations at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-class/">http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-class/</a>, so for study purposes you should probably use the
stable copies on Blackboard.

<p>
You may find some useful topic ideas in:
<a href="http://iac.dtic.mil/iatac/download/security.pdf">Goertzel et al, Software Security Assurance State of the Art Report, May 2007</a>.

<p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to write programs.
This is a practical class for developing programs, and you&#8217;ll have a
programming project as part of the class.
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to read and understand programs in both Java and C.
The principles are language-independent, but
I have to pick <i>some</i> languages so we can discuss specific examples.
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Java and C
are two of the top programming languages according to the
TIOBE programming community index</a>;
using both lets us examine a variety of real-world issues with
widely-used languages.
In particular, C lets us examine issues that can only occur in
memory-unsafe languages (e.g., C, C++, and Objective-C), while
Java lets us examine issues that can still occur in memory-safe languages.
Some students have had success learning C simultaneously, but plan to
spend a lot of extra time if you do that.
You&#8217;ll need to be able to understand both Java and C code for
the mid-term exam, and I can&#8217;t be a language tutor.

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>

<p>
The lectures will cover the key issues and
explain some things that might not be clear otherwise.
However, you are responsible for reading and understanding the material
in the assigned readings (and not just knowing what&#8217;s in the lectures).
Note that there is a significant amount of reading, especially
in the first half of the course; we then move into more specialized
topics and application.

<p>
First actual class date is September 2, 2015;
the last normal class day is December 9.
I do not plan for us to meet on the exam day, but please hold it open
just in case I change my mind.
We do not meet on November 25 due to Thanksgiving recess.
See the
<a href="http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/">GMU calendar</a>
for general information on the GMU calendar.
I routinely check the list of
<a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/calendar/religious-holiday-calendar/">&#8221;non-work&#8221;

	<td>Pick a known vulnerability in a specific program from the <a href="http://samate.nist.gov/SARD/">NIST Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD, formerly the SAMATE Reference Dataset (SRD))</a> or similar source.  Please look at several examples before you pick one to write about (you can click on a test case id to see its specifics)! Do not just pick the first one in the list, but try to be a little more random; I do not want to read about the same one from everyone.  Then write a short (1-2 page) paper showing the vulnerable code snippet, explaining the vulnerability (where is the vulnerability? why is it vulnerable? what kind of vulnerability is it?), and explaining how it could be fixed (give specifics).  Be sure to cite your source(s).  This is intended to be an easy assignment to give you early experience looking at programs with vulnerabilities. Looking at vulnerable programs, with information on why they&#8217;re vulnerable, can help you find vulnerabilities in other programs... and is great practice for the mid-term.</td>

The purpose of the presentation is to give you experience in being an effective <i>advocate</i> for others to do (or not do) something, to improve security; it also gives the rest of us a taste of the many other issues in the field.

(If you have a compelling work reason, or there is an odd number of students, I may allow a 1-person group.  Trios are possible but discouraged; ask permission first.)  Please get to know your classmates so you can pick a partner you can work with.  This is a critical part of the course, because it gives you <i>experience</i> in <i>applying</i> the concepts.  By working in pairs, you can easily review each other&#8217;s work, and reduce the effort too.  If I believe (based on the information I receive) that someone didn&#8217;t do any significant useful work on the programming project, then the non-worker gets a 0 for the project.   My goal is not to be punitive; my goal is to protect everyone from &#8220;partners who won&#8217;t work&#8221;.  I think this is fair, indeed, it&#8217;s not fair to give someone credit for work not done.  If you find yourself in a situation where your partner isn&#8217;t doing real work (after your project begins), please let me know as early as you can.  I realize that the potential downside of pair/group work is that one person might end up doing all the work.  I hope that this will reduce that risk.</td>

I grade on results, not effort.

<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and <i>don&#8217;t distract others</i>.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate (and not make noise) in class.
<p>
Please talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with the mid-term, your topic presentation, or final presentation,
e.g., a <a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.
I can easily reschedule topic presentations; the others are much harder.
Don&#8217;t bother telling me if you&#8217;ll miss other class times;
I strongly recommend class attendance, but I understand if
work, family, or other commitments sometimes make that difficult to do.
You can always turn in work early
(e.g., if the deadline conflicts with a religious holiday).

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
GMU is an <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>
university; please see the University Catalog for
a full description of the code and the honor committee process. The
principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations
are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this
course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&#8217;s work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance
and clarification.
<b>Do not plagiarize.</b>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Please use the instructor&#8217;s email address for class questions.
You <i>must</i> use your Mason email account for all email correspondence
having anything to do with your work at Mason.  Federal laws protecting your
privacy rights require that we only communicate student information
directly to students - and use of the university email system is our
only way to validate your identity when using email.
You may forward your campus email elsewhere,
but we can respond <i>only</i> to a Mason email account.
This is per
<a href="http://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/employees-electronic-communications/">GMU policy 1315</a>.

<p>
We can also communicate via Blackboard, however, I only intermittently
look at the Discussion Board on Blackboard, so that's a terrible way
to get my attention.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
it&#8217;s nice to let me know as a courtesy, but you must
contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 703-993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations <i>must</i> be arranged through the ODS,
not through me.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me), please bring that <i>form</i> to me.

<h1>Comments and successes of past students</h1>

<p>
The following are comments of past students.
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2012/05/17/">In 2012
I received the &#8220;outstanding adjunct faculty&#8221; award, primarily
for teaching this class</a>, and some of these comments
were in support of this award:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Your class got me a raise at work... I feel that your class has directly [led] to higher levels of reliability and security in some of our nation&#8217;s voting systems all while assisting me in developing cost reduction methods...  Your practical input and answering questions (even staying late) helped many of my classmates... your class has a direct impact of many of my job functions. Not only that, the books and papers your assigned was not filler - all your books and papers are either well-known for their value in the Information Security/Assure community and/or highly praised on amazon by other leaders in the field like yourself...  Your class is tied for first place with me (along with Angelos Stavarou&#8217;s [OS Security Class])... [you] made it exciting, useful, and approachable.&#8221;
<li>&#8220;I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be one of your students... Before taking the class, I had no idea what an SQL injection was, but now all my database transactions are protected against SQL injections. Also, I utilized what I have learned about SSL/TLS...&#8221;
<li>&#8220;... GMU should... make the course (or something like it) mandatory for all CS graduates...&#8221; - Carl Bohman.
<li>&#8220;I took up ISA681 in Fall 2011. And the effects are rewarding. I have been working as a Research Assistant since and your stress on sanitizing inputs has helped me not only on a security front but also to solve on problems with data normalization which often happens with data collected in the real world. Thank you for the amazing learning experience.&#8221;
<li>&#8220;This course helped me understand that security must be built in from the start not added on later. By understanding what kinds of programming errors can expose security vulnerabilities, I am better able to write code that is more secure. I also learned a lot about testing and how &#8220;bad people&#8221; find vulnerabilities and use them to steal...&#8221; - Leslie Jeffries
<li>&#8220;I really enjoyed your class and it has helped me on my current job quite a bit. I work in a classified environment and although we run our production system isolated from [the] internet the security of our system is still highly valued. Since your class I have been able to decrease the vulnerability of the code I write as well as make more valuable contributions to code reviews. My level of knowledge in secure coding is much deeper than it was prior to your class. I also feel I am more security conscious than many of my peers. Outside of my day job, I&#8217;ve also spent the last couple of years working on a prototype that I plan to build a company around. The nature of this product is deeply rooted in many of the topics we discussed in your class and I still review your course materials frequently. [The class] was among the top few classes in all of my MS studies.&#8221;
<li>&#8220;[I&#8217;m] looking for work [and] in my interviews I often get a chance to talk about the group project which I participated in for your class and how we included features in our design which made it more secure. I must have learned something relevant because some of the interviewers seemed to know what I was talking about...&#8221; - Daniel Ryan
<li>&#8220;This was indeed a very good learning experience for me. And I promise I will apply security features in all my work as a software professional!&#8221;
</ul>
<p>
Amin Tora, one of my former students,
found and reported a vulnerability in Apache
(involving not updating the length of a string) that has since been fixed.
