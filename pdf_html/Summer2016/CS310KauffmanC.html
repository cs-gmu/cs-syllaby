<p>
CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211. Students
will learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming
problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a significant part
of this course and students should expect to spend a good deal of time
on the programming projects.  The course also introduces a variety of
data structures and illustrates the types of problems for which they
are useful.
</p>

<p>
Topics to be covered include.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Generics and Collections
</li>
<li>Basic Complexity Analysis
</li>
<li>Linked Lists
</li>
<li>Stacks and Queues
</li>
<li>Simple and Balanced Binary Search Trees

<p>
By the end of the semester, a passing student will be able to carry
out the following types of activities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reinforced what they have learned about elementary data structures
from CS 211
</li>
<li>Extended their knowledge of data structures to more sophisticated
data structures. This includes balanced binary search trees, B-trees
and B+-trees, hashing, and basic graphs.
</li>
<li>Use generic types in their data structures.
</li>
<li>Do more demanding programming than they had in CS 211. All
programming is done in Java. This involves more program design and
debugging techniques.

<h3 id="sec-4-3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Homework Grading and Disputes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Programming homework grading will usually be divided into two portions
weighted 50% for each portion.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automatic Testing (50%): Public tests will be used to assess the
correctness of programs.  Running these tests while constructing
your program will indicate exactly what your score on this portion
will be.
</li>
<li>Manual Inspection (50%): Each project will include a checklist of
features your programs should exhibit. These usually comprise
things that cannot be easily checked via unit tests such as good
variable name selection, proper decomposition of a problem into
multiple functions or cooperating objects, overall design elegance,
and proper asymptotic complexity.  These features will be checked
by graders and assigned credit based on level of compliance.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Address grading issues with the grader first, usually a GTA that is
listed in the grading feedback.  This should be done respectfully
either in person or via e-mail.  If it is not possible to reach a
resolution, the professor may be contacted by the grader to resolve
the dispute.
</p>

<p>
If you have not initiated contact within <b>1 week</b> after receiving a
grade, the chance to contest the grade has closed.

<h3 id="sec-4-4"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Homework Deadlines, Late Submission, Late Tokens</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Homework is due via electronic submission by 11:59 p.m. on the dates
specified.  You can submit work to BlackBoard as many times as
desired.  Only the last submission will be graded.
</li>
<li>Work will <b>not be accepted</b> more than 48 hours after the assigned deadline
</li>
<li>Late work will be accepted with a -25% penalty per 24-hour period
late within the acceptance deadline.  The penalty is a <i>ceiling penalty</i>
which lowers the maximum score that can be received.

<p>
<b>Examples:</b> HW is due on 10/10 at 11:59pm and Jafar hands in his
assignment on 10/11 at 1:00pm (13 hours late). Jafar would have
scored 83 but instead gets min(83, 100-1*25) = 75.  
</p>

<p>
Iago hands his assignment in on 10/12 at 10:00pm (46 hours late);
his un-adjusted score is 43 and with the late penalties his score
is still 43: min(43, 100-2*25) = 43.  
</p>

<p>
Cassim submits his assignment on 10/13 at 3:00am (51 hours late) but
receives a 0 because his submission is beyond the final cutoff..
</p>
</li>

<li>Each student starts the semester with three <b>Day-Late Tokens</b>.
Whenever a student turns in a project late, tokens are
<b>automatically</b> applied to the assignment. One token removes the
penalty for submitting one day late.  Assignments will not be
accepted more than 48 hours late regardless of late tokens.

<p>
<b>Examples:</b> HW is due on 10/10 at 11:59pm and Jafar hands in his
assignment on 10/11 at 1:00pm (13 hours late). The TAs automatically
deduct 1 late token from Jafar's stock so he receives no late
penalty and gets an 83 on the HW.
</p>

<p>
Iago hands his assignment in on 10/12 at 10:00pm (46 hours late);
his un-adjusted score is 79.  He has only 1 late token which is
automatically deducted to remove one day of late penalties. His
final score after penalties are applied is min(79, 100-1*25) = 75.  
</p>

<p>
Cassim submits his assignment on 10/13 at 3:00am (51 hours
late). Despite having 3 late tokens, Cassim receives a 0 because his
submission is beyond the final cutoff.
</p>

<li>Each late token remaining at the end of the semester are worth a
<b>0.25% bonus</b> to a student's overall grade.
</li>
<li>On-time submissions will generally be graded and available a week
from submission, though exceptional circumstances may cause delays.
Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as schedules
allow.
</li>
<li>Contact the professor as soon as possible if health or family
emergencies occur that would interfere with completing course work.

<p>
Bonus credit will be awarded based on participation in class
discussions in lecture.  Students may elect to sit in the first few
rows of the room ("hot seats") and answer questions.  Reasonable
effort on answering questions in class will garner class participation
credit.  Participation points may also earned for involvement in the
class discussion board such as giving suggestions to students with
questions (but not revealing answers wholesale).  The highest point
winner at the end of the semester will receive a 3% bonus to their
overall score in the course.  All other students will receive a bonus
proportional to the highest point winner.  For example, someone tied
with the highest point scorer will also receive a 3% bonus while
someone with half the participation points will receive a 1.5% bonus.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talking to other students in the course about HW problems and
informally describing how a problem may be solved.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be <b>very careful</b> as you do this that you do not share any sort of
code as this will be detected.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting or giving help fixing a small bug or two: a second set
of eyes is a great boon to finding that misplaced semicolon that is
preventing your code from compiling.
</li>
<li>Searching the Internet for alternative presentations of a
programming concept.  
</li>
<li>When unsure whether collaboration is fair or not, stop the activity
until it can be cleared with instructor.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#PRIME-DIRECTIVE">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with
another student.  The above collaborations should be limited to
getting someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish
line.  Doing programming projects individually prepares you for the
exams in which no collaboration of any kind is allowed.

<p>
Since this is a programming course, some special policies will be in
effect.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming assignments will be submitted to Blackboard at the
specified dates.  You may submit assignments to Blackboard as many
times as you like: only the most recent submission will be graded
(up to the deadline). 
</li>
<li>Back up your program regularly.  Keeping backup copies of your work
is your responsibility.  Losing work due to a disk failure,
accidental deletion, etc., is not a justification for late
submission.  Technologies like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> automate the task of backing
up which can make life much easier and safer.  Submitting occasional
early versions to Blackboard is also wise.  Should last-minute
problems happen such as accidental deletion, you will at least have
some of your work to show.  No code to submit means no credit.
</li>
<li>Submitted code that does not compile will receive little to no
credit. 
</li>
<li>When test cases are provided by the instructor use them and make
sure your code passes all tests.
</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how plagiarism works with programming as
described in other parts of the syllabus.
</li>
<li>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission. It is
important that you not touch your programs once you have made your
final submission. If there are any submission problems,
consideration for credit will only be given if it can be verified
that the programs were not changed after being submitted.

<p>
Students are expected to maintain a high level of civility for all
participants in and out of class meetings.  This includes respecting
the beliefs of participants of all genders, ethnicities, and social
backgrounds.  Harassment of any type will not be tolerated and failure
to behave in a respectful manner will result in referrals to

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Guidelines for Success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most homework problems have analogs that are (1) discussed in
lecture or (2) described in an example problem in the textbook.
This should encourage you to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attend lecture and take notes
</li>
<li>Read the content of each section of the textbook carefully
</li>
<li>Analyze the example code distributed by the instructor
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most successful students do all of these.
</p>
</li>
<li>Seek help from the instructor or teaching assistant when a
concept is unclear.  If you blow a problem on a HW or exam and don't
see why, attend office hours to ask about it.  We are here to aid
your learning process.
</li>
<li>Form good habits early on.  We have a large amount of material to
cover which means you will need to spend time outside of lecture
reading and experimenting. Things will move <b>fast</b> so don't fall
behind.
</li>
<li>There is a wealth of information on data structures online.  Don't
be afraid to consult online tutorials if a particular topic is
troublesome for you.  However, <b>do not</b> misuse to the Internet to
obtain solutions that you don't understand.  Follow the <b><a href="#PRIME-DIRECTIVE">PRIME
DIRECTIVE</a></b> at all times.
