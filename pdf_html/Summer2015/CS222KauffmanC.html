<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Course Description and Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Modern engineering is almost always done using computers either as an
aid or a primary modeling tool.  To that end, it is essential for
engineers to have a cursory understanding of how to exploit
computation to meet their objectives.  This course will discuss
fundamental aspects of programming in the C language.  The C language
is designed to be close to the hardware on which it runs giving a
programmer full control over the machine.  This is in contrast to
higher level languages such as Python and Java which insulate the
programmer from hardware.  Programs in C have very direct access to
the underlying architecture of the execution device making C ideal for
applications in which careful control of the device is required.  This
is particularly relevant for engineers working with computing hardware
or other electronics.
</p>

<p>
Students in the course are assumed to have prior programming
experience (see prerequisites) so that basic programming concepts such
as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and aggregate data are
familiar.  We will cover how these elements are expressed in C and how
they are assembled to construct programs.  We will also cover the set
of tools which support C programs including compilers, preprocessors,
standard libraries, and potentially debuggers.  Near the end of the
course, we will spend a short amount of time discussing the C++
language which extends C to include some high-level programming
constructs.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Each lecture will be divided in half: 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture
and discussion followed by a 15 break and then another 1 hour and 15
minutes of lecture.  We will discuss programming concepts and I will
provide demos of programming relevant to assignments. In addition to
attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to
visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to
further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you
learn.
</p>

<p>
Attendance of lectures is expected but not mandatory.  Lectures are
meant to assist students in learning the material and meet
expectations on homework and exams.  However, no formal attendance
will be kept.  When attending lecture and discussion, students are
expected to arrive on time, avoid disruptions to presentations and
discussion, and be respectful to the instructor and fellow learners.
During lecture, new material will be introduced and discussed.  Also,
example problems will be solved which have the same character as those
on homework.  Participating in lectures are also the source of <a href="#bonus-credit">bonus

Readings from the textbook relevant to each lecture are listed in the
schedule.  You will increase your understanding of lectures by reading
associated textbook sections ahead of time, though this is not
assumed.  I may provide additional reading material to supplement the
textbook which will be posted on the course web page.

There will be a number of programming assignments during the semester.
Each assignment will involve writing programs and answering questions
about them to illustrate an understanding of course material.  The
programming assignments will be electronically submitted to Blackboard
on dates specified in the assignment by 11:59 p.m.  Students may
submit assignments as many times as needed up to the deadline.

All exams will be <b>open book, open notes, open computing devices</b> but
no internet search or communication will be allowed.  Exam questions
will be designed such that learning a concept on the fly will take too

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming homework is due via electronic submission by 11:59
p.m. on the dates specified.  You can submit work to BlackBoard as
many times as desired.  Only the last submission will be graded.
</li>
<li>Each student starts the semester with <b>three Day-Late Tokens</b>.
Whenever a student turns in a project late, tokens
are <b>automatically</b> applied to the assignment.  Late tokens prevent
the below late penalties from taking effect.
</li>
<li>At the end of the semester, each unused Day-Late Token is worth
0.25% in overall bonus credit for the course.
</li>
<li>Late work will be penalized by the <b>min-25</b> system
</li>
<li>A penalty of 25% is assessed each 24-hour period entered after the
deadline (when late-tokens are gone). For example, if you turn in
work half a day late and score 87%, you will receive min(87,75) =
75% (and not 87-25=62%).
</li>
<li>Work turned in more than <b>two 24-hours periods late will earn zero
points</b> and will only be graded as time permits. To clarify, you
can't use tokens and penalties to turn work in 3 or more days late;
this would earn zero points.
</li>
<li>You can submit work to BlackBoard as many times as desired.  Only
the last submission will be graded. If you anticipate being rushed
around the submission deadline, be sure to submit a version before
the deadline as a backup, in case you find yourself only moments
late in meeting a deadline.
</li>
<li>The graduate grader grades the programming HW and should be
contacted first about disputes
</li>
<li>On-time submissions will generally be graded and available a week
from submission, though exceptional circumstances may cause delays.
Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as schedules
allow.
</li>
<li>Contact the professor as soon as possible if health or family
emergencies occur that would interfere with completing course work.

<p>
Since this is a programming course, some special policies will be in
effect.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming projects will be submitted to Blackboard at the
specified dates.  You may submit assignments to Blackboard as many
times as you like: only the most recent submission will be graded
(up to the deadline). 
</li>
<li><b>Back up your program regularly</b>. Free cloud storage services
offered by Dropbox, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have eliminated "my
computer crashed" as a valid excuse for lateness. <b>No
accommodations</b> will be made for personal computing or hardware
problems.
</li>
<li>Submitting occasional early versions to Blackboard is creates a
safety net for submitted work. Should last-minute problems happen
such as accidental deletion, partial credit can be garnered for the
work that has been submitted.  No code to submit means no credit.
</li>
<li>Submitted code that does not compile will receive little to no
credit. 
</li>
<li>When test cases are provided by the instructor use them and make
sure your code passes all tests.
</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how plagiarism works with programming in
the next section of the syllabus.
</li>
<li>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission. It is
important that you not touch your programs once you have made your
final submission. If there are any submission problems,
consideration for credit will only be given if it can be verified
that the programs were not changed after being submitted.

PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including
homework code and exam solutions. The work you submit should be the
product of your own effort and reflect your personal understanding.
</p>
</b>

<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
PRIME DIRECTIVE. Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  More specific guidelines are given below.

Unless otherwise specified, all assessments in this course are
individual efforts involving no unfair collaboration.  For the
purposes of this course, the following actions constitute scholastic
misconduct (cheating) and will be reported.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Directly copying someone else's solution to an assessment problem,
including student solutions from a previous semester
</li>
<li>Directly copying an answer from some outside source such as the
Internet or friend for a homework problem
</li>
<li>Making use of an Instructor Solution manual to complete problems
</li>
<li>Paying someone for a homework solution or submitting someone else's
work as your own
</li>
<li>Posting solutions to any web site including public posts to our
course web site
</li>
<li>Collaborating or copying someone else's answer during an exam
</li>
<li>Aiding or abetting any of the above

Any instance of misconduct that is detected will be referred to the
honor board and will likely result in failing the course.  Be advised
that the teaching team will be employing <b>electronic means to detect
plagiarism</b>.  This is extremely easy with computer code so keep your
nose clean.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talking to other students in the course about HW problems and
informally describing how a problem may be solved.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be <b>very careful</b> as you do this that you do not share any sort of
code as this will be detected.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting or giving help fixing a small bug or two: a second set
of eyes is a great boon to finding that misplaced semicolon that is
preventing your code from compiling.
</li>
<li>Searching the Internet for alternative presentations of a
programming concept.  
</li>
<li>Reading and working together on the exercises contained in the
textbook with other students. The text contains many good readings
and exercises for unrestricted group work.
</li>
<li>When unsure whether collaboration is fair or not, stop the activity
until it can be cleared with instructor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#prime-directive">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with
another student.  The above collaborations should be limited to
getting someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish
line.

<p>
Students are expected to maintain a high level of civility for all
participants in and out of class meetings.  This includes respecting
the beliefs of participants of all genders, ethnicities, and social
backgrounds.  Harassment of any type will not be tolerated and failure
to behave in a respectful manner will result in referrals to
University Counseling or the Office of Student Judicial Affairs.  Any
instances of sexual harassment will be reported to the Office of Equal
Opportunity according to the <a href="http://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/1202gen.html">University wide policy.</a>
</p>

<p>
Observance of religious events will be accommodated for students of any
faith.
</p>

<p>
All possible accommodations will be made for students with
disabilities.  Please contact Disability Services

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Guidelines for Success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most homework problems have analogs that are (1) discussed in
lecture or (2) described in an example problem in the textbook.
This should encourage you to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attend lecture and take notes
</li>
<li>Read the content of each section of the textbook carefully
</li>
<li>Analyze the example code distributed by the instructor
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seek help from the instructor or teaching assistant when a
concept is unclear.  If you blow a problem on a HW or exam and don't
see why, attend office hours to ask about it.  We are here to aid
your learning process.
</li>
<li>Form good habits early on.  This is a summer class so we will go at
<b>twice the speed</b> of a regular semester.  To help you absorb that
much information, it will be very useful to read some of the
material ahead of time.  Things will move <b>fast</b> so don't fall
behind.
</li>
<li>C Programming has been around for a long time and there is a wealth
of information on it online.  Don't be afraid to consult online
tutorials if a particular aspect of C programming is troublesome for
you.  However, <b>do not</b> misuse to the Internet to obtain solutions
that you don't understand.  Follow the <a href="#prime-directive">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> at all times.
</li>
<li>In addition to online resources, the library has a number of
alternative textbooks on C programming.  Explore the stacks and
find something that works for you.
