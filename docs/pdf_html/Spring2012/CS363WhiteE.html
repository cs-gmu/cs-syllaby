<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
At the end of this course, students should
<ol>
<li>be able to read and use formal representations of programming language syntax.
</li><li>understand, in a language independent way, basic programming language components
such as variables, types, expressions, scope and control flow and see the choices made
for these components by common languages.
</li><li> have an understanding of runtime procedure/function control and data flow
implementation.
</li><li> have a basic understanding of the major programming language paradigms
(imperative, OO, functional, logic), including relevant application domains, strengths and
weaknesses.
</li><li> have an understanding of the fundamentals of concurrent programming and the language-level constructs that used in concurrent programming.
</li><li> gain basic programming competence in several different types of programming
languages, facilitating transition to other current (and future) languages encountered
during their professional career.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Programming
     Assignments (4 @ 10% each)</li>
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="circle">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level2 lfo1;tab-stops:list 1.0in">This
      class will require you to write programs in several different programming
      languages. </li>
 </ul>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><span class="SpellE">Homeworks</span> (10%)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Exams: Exam 1 (15%), Exam 2 (15%)  and Final (20%)
     </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Policies:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Programming assignments are to be <b>individual</b> efforts, meaning no sharing of code or
discussion of problem solution allowed with anyone but me.
</li><li> Late policy:
<ul>
<li> One day: 10% deduction
</li><li> Two days: 30% deduction
</li><li> Three days: 50% deduction
</li><li> More than 3 days - no credit
</li></ul>
</li><li>You must turn in  a working version of all programming assignments to pass the class (even if it receives no credit).
</li></ul>

<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts. Information on the university honor code
can be found at:
<br><tt><a href="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html</a></tt>
<p>
This semester I will probably be using similarity detection software to 
assist me in finding honor code violations, should they occur.
