<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students become 
              effective professionals in the field of computer science by 
examining          many    of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding 
computer         technology    and its use, and building a foundation for 
dealing with     those    challenges.    Students will examine the philosophical 
bases for    ethical   decision-making    and how to apply them to issues 
raised by computers   and   technology. Specific    topics covered in CS 105,
such as intellectual   property   concerns, will be addressed by this course
 in a more intensive   manner.   Emerging legal and ethical issues involved
in the computer profession   and    e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
                                                           
<p>Throughout the course, students will be expected to apply critical thinking
              skills in individual and group settings to evaluate various
issues       related      to computer law and ethics.  Students will connect
issues    of   technology    to  wider societal concerns through class discussion,
    a  mock    trial, and the creation of a hypothetical trial scenario.
 Students       will   use critical thinking skills to evaluate and prepare
formal arguments        concerning   their assigned mock trial topics, which
they will present     to   their classmates.    Students should be prepared
to participate during     class   activities, to interact  with their classmates,
 and to reflect  upon   and refine  their personal points  of view on various
 ethical issues.  </p>

a topic of law  and ethics,    to be submitted  in several stages, including
at least one  draft that will    be given feedback  and revised for an additional
grade.   Students will also complete various short writing assignments individually,
