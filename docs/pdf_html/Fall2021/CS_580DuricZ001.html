<h1>CS 580 - 001 </h1>
<h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Wednesday 4:30 pm - 7:10 pm in Music/Theater
Building Rm. 1007
<b>

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>
<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a
href="https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2021/cs580/home">https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2021/cs580/home</a>
will be used for discussions. All course materials including slides,
homeworks, and projects will be posted on the course blackboard page. 
<p><h3>Textbook</h3>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,
4th ed., Russell & Norvig, 
             Prentice Hall
<p><h3>Supplementary texts</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Artifical Intelligence, Poole & Mackworth, 2nd ed., <a
  href="https://artint.info">book online</a>
  </ul>

  <p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>	A working knowledge of computer systems and several
		programming languages is required.  The material covered
		in CS 310 (or INFS 519/CS 531) and CS 330 (or CS 530) as well as general computer science
		maturity is assumed and used throughout the course.
  
<p><h3> Content </h3>	The course can be roughly divided in two
                parts: (i) Intelligence from computation including
                uninformed and informed search, adverserial search,
                constraint satisfaction, markov decison processes, and
                reinforcement learning; (ii) Intelligence from data
                including probailistic reasoning, and unsupervised and
                supervised machine learning methods.The Python
                programming language will be used as the primary
                language for homework assignments. 

<p><h3>Exams </h3> There will be a midterm and final exam.

  <p><h3> Homework </h3>	There will be several programming assignments which will
		include written summaries. Other assignments could
		include practice problems from the textbook and/or old
		exams. 

  <p><h3> Grading</h3>	The course grade will be determined approximately as
		follows:
  <ul>
<li> homework:	40%
<li> midterm:	25%
<li>  final:	35%
    </ul>


<p><h3>Individual work</h3>
You are free to discuss ideas for both the labs and projects with
    other students, however <b>no joint work is permitted</b> unless
    explicitely stated in the assignment. Any submitted work must be yours alone. Any work which shows too much similarity with others' submitted work will receive a grade of 0. Extreme or repeat cases may result in failing the course or referral to the Honor Commitee.
<br><br>
Read the <a
  href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
  Department honor code</a> and the <a
  href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">University honor code</a>. You are
  bound by these honor codes.
