    <p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students
      become effective professionals in the field of computer science by
      examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding
      computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing
      with those challenges. Students will examine the philosophical bases for
      ethical decision-making and how to apply them to issues raised by
      computers and technology. Specific topics covered in CS 105/110, such as
      intellectual property concerns, will be addressed by this course in a more
      intensive manner. Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the
      computer profession and e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is
        a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much of
        our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
        dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
        chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
        apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
        opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
        may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
        and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that you
        will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU
          are the most important component of this class, so please come
          prepared to think, discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At
          the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you
          disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>

    <p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a Writing Intensive (WI)
      Course that, together with CS 321, meets the GMU WI Requirements for the
      BS CS and BS ACS programs. Accordingly, each student in CS 306 is required
      to write a minimum of 1750 individual words, which will be graded and
      returned to the student with feedback. This requirement will be
      fulfilled&nbsp;by a series of short essays analyzing legal and ethical
      issues, most of which may be revised and resubmitted for an improved grade
      after receiving feedback. <b>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Each</span>
        of the first three essays&nbsp;must meet minimum wordcount requirements
        <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> earn a final grade of C or
        better in order to receive a C or better in the course.</b> Students
      will also be writing in-class essays for short exams. &nbsp;In addition,
      students will work with partners to research and write materials in
      preparation for their&nbsp;Mock Trials.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Grading Policy:</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Class Participation (incl. short assignments and
      discussion boards) (15%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Short quizzes on assigned reading and recent lecture
      material (20%)<br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work: &nbsp;You are expected to submit
      all work by the due date. &nbsp;</span>Late work may be accepted at the
    discretion of the instructor, but &nbsp;will be subject to a late penalty,
    typically 5-10% per day (incl. weekends).<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;The group project is divided into five parts, and no late
      work&nbsp;will be accepted after the due date for the next sequential
      part. &nbsp;NO late work of any kind will be accepted after Saturday, Dec.
      4, 2021. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Attendance:</span> &nbsp;Although this is an online class, most sessions
    will be conducted synchronously through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra (or
    Zoom for Sec. DL7). &nbsp;Students should plan to log in to class each day
    through BB (or Zoom), prepared to participate through the chat box but also
    to use audio and webcam when requested. Failure to do so will be reflected
    in your class participation grade. Group project grading may include a
    confidential review of participating group members by each student, and
    individual grades may be adjusted later in the semester if deemed
    appropriate based on repeated lack of participation as evidenced by either
    instructor observation or report by fellow group members. <b>If an
