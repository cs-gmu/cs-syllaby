		  <h2>Description</h2>
		  <p>This course covers the principles and techniques behind
the design of modern, reliable, and high-performance distributed
systems. Topics include server design, network programming,
concurrency and locking, consistency models and techniques, and fault
tolerance. Modern techniques and systems employed at some of the
largest Internet sites (e.g., Google, Facebook, Amazon) will also be
covered. Through programming assignments, students will gain
practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real
distributed systems. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Course website</h2>
		  The materials will be published on the course website: <a
		  href="https://tddg.github.io/cs475-fall21/">https://tddg.github.io/cs475-fall21/</a>.</p>
		  <br/>

		  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		  <p>Students are required to have previously taken CS 367
(Computer Systems & Programming).</p>

		  <p>This is a programming-intensive course. You need to be
comfortable with programming in one of the following languages
including C, Python, Java. Knowing a language serves as a soft
prerequisite and would get you prepared to learn a new language (if
you haven’t already) and do the programming assignments in this
course.</p>

		  <p>This semester you will be learning a new language <a
href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> as all assignments will be in
Go.</p>

		  <p>It is also not a good idea to take this class if your
course/work schedule is already quite full.</p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Textbooks</h2>
		  <p>There are no official textbooks. Required readings are
(most frequently) in the form of research papers and/or selected
textbook chapters. There are several books that might be useful,
however: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/">Distributed Systems 3rd edition (2017)</a>, by Maarten van Steen and Andrew S. Tenenbaum (suggested optional readings will most frequently be drawn from this book). </li>
			<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)</a>, 
                by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Aug, 2018 (v 1.00)</li>
			<li>The Go Programming Language. Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan (<a href="http://www.gopl.io/">Web page</a>). </li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Course outcomes</h2>
		  <p>Upon completion of this course, the students should be able to: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>To get an overview of practical, modern distributed
systems, with an eye toward datacenter systems in particular.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental
concepts in standard distributed systems techniques and
infrastructure (RPC, consensus, fault tolerance, consistency,
scalability).</li>
			<li>To learn how to approach, discuss, and communicate
about difficult and technical subject matter. </li>
			<li>Demonstrate an ability to design and implement
concurrent & distributed systems using modern technologies.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Topics</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>Introduction</li>
			<li>Fundamentals</li>
			<li>Fault tolerance and consensus</li>
			<li>Consistency, scalability, transactions</li>
			<li>Big data processing</li>
			<li>Datacenter techniques</li>
			<li>Reasoning about system performance</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>

		  <!--h2>Course materials</h2>
		  <p>All course materials, including lecture notes, are
		  available through the course homepage at <a
		  href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs471_fall17.html">https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs471_fall17.html</a>.</p>
		  </br-->

		  <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
		  <p>Students must work individually on all programming
assignments. We encourage you to have high-level discussions with
other students in the class about the assignments.</p>

		  <p>However, we require that when you turn in an assignment,
it is only your work. That is, copying any part of another student’s
assignment is strictly prohibited. Anything that you hand in, whether
it is a written problem or a computer program, must be written in
your own words. If you base your solution on any other written
solution, you are cheating.</p>

		  <p>Never look at another student’s code or share your code with any other student.</p>

		  <p>You must not make your code public (on GitHub/GitLab or by any other means).</p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Programming Assignments</h2>
		  <p>You will learn how to use Go as we go.  Details
concerning the programming assignments (labs) will be presented in
class. All students should have accounts on the <a
		  href="zeus.vse.gmu.edu">VSE Unix cluster</a> (aka zeus.vse.gmu.edu).
		  Instructions and related links can be found <a
		  href="http://labs.ite.gmu.edu/index.php/FAQ/ClusterAccount">here</a>.
		  </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Late Policy</h2>
		  <p>10% will be deducted for late assignments each day after
the due date. That is, if an assignment is late, we’ll grade it and
scale the score by 0.9 if it is up to one day late, by 0.8 if it is
up to two days late, and by 0.7 if it is up to three days late.</p>

		  <p>Late assignments will only be accepted for 3 days after the due date. Assignments submitted more than 3 days late will receive a zero. If you’re worried about being busy around the time of a HW submission, please plan ahead and get started early.</p>

		  <p>Assignment that does not compile or run will receive at most 50% credit.</p></br>


		  <h2>Grading policy</h2>
		  <p>Your grade will be calcuated as follows: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>60% projects</li>
			<li>5% quizes and in-class activities</li>
			<li>15% midterm exam</li>
			<li>20% final exam</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The final grade is computed according to the following rules: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A+: >= 95%; A: [90%, 95%); A-: [85%, 90%)</li>
            <li>B+: [80%, 85%); B: [75%, 80%); B-: [70%, 75%)</li>
            <li>C+: [66%, 70%); C: [63%, 66%); C-: [60%, 63%)</li>
            <li>D: [50%, 60%)</li>
            <li>F: < 50% </li>
          </ul>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Academic integrity</h2>
		  <p>All students must adhere to the 
		  <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">
			GMU Honor Code</a>
		  and the 
		  <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">
			Computer Science
			Department's Honor Code
		  </a>
		  Policies. The students are supposed to work individually on
		  the homeworks, assignments projects, unless told otherwise.
		  We reserve the right to use 
		  <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">
			MOSS
		  </a>
		  to detect plagiarism. Violation of the Honor
		  Code will result in an F. </p>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Accommodations for disabilities</h2>
		  <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may
		  affect academic performance, you should: </p>
		  <ol>
			<li>make sure this documentation is
			  on file with Office for Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 4205; 993-2474;
			  <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">
				http://ods.gmu.edu</a>) to determine the accommodations you need;</li> 
			<li>talk
			  with the instructor within the first week of the semester
			  to discuss any accommodation needs.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </br>
