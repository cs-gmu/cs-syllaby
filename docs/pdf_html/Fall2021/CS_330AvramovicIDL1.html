      <span class="section">Description</span></p><p>
      This course is an introduction to two kinds of formal systems - 
      languages and logics - with important applications to computer science. 
      The study of formal languages underlies important aspects of compilers
      and other language processing systems, as well as the theory of 
      computation. Various systems of logic and automatic reasoning are put 
      to use in artificial intelligence, database theory and software 
      engineering. The entire course will give you practice in precise 
      thinking and proof methods that play a role in the analysis of 
      algorithms. The programming assignments provide practical experience 
      with some theoretical topics.</p><p> 

      <span class="section">Outcomes</span></p><p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>

            please do not use laptops, cellphones, or similar electronic 
            devices during class without special permission
        </li>-->
        <li>
            it is a departmental requirement that all undergraduate Computer 
            Science students taking CS330 <span class="emph">must speak with their 
            advisor</span> during the semester and submit 
            <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/media/uploads/programs/undergraduate/cs/advisorchecklist.pdf">
            an advising form</a> documenting their visit; failure to do so will result in 
            an Incomplete grade (either a signed copy of the form or an emailed confirmation from the 
			advisor must be sent to both myself and to the department, at 
			<a href="mailto:csug@gmu.edu">csug@gmu.edu</a>).

		<li>
		    Campus closure due to inclement weather will not affect this course, as the course is fully
			online.
		</li>
		<li>
		    Inclement weather (power outages) may still impact student participation in the course.  Recordings
			of the course will be available, in the event that a student cannot participate due to power/Internet 
			outage.  If a power outage occurs during an exam, note the timetime of the outage and contact the 
			instructor as soon as possible.  If the lecture itself is disrupted due to power outage and unable to resume,
			announcements will be posted to Piazza and the lecture may be supplemented by pre-recorded videos.

      be treated as a violation of George Mason's <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code">
      Honor Code</a> and will typically result in failing the class.</p><p>
	  
	  Some kinds of participation in third-party online study sites violate the GMU Honor code: these include accessing exam or quiz questions for this class which have been uploaded by others; accessing exam, quiz, or assignment answers for this class; uploading of any of the instructor's materials or exams; and uploading any of your own answers or finished work.  Always consult with the course instructors before using these sites.</p><p>
