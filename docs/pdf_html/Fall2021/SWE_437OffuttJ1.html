<P>
<b>Description</b>:

   Concepts and techniques for testing and modifying software in evolving environments.
   Topics include software testing at the unit, module, subsystem, and system levels;
   developer testing;
   automatic and manual techniques for generating test data;
   testing concurrent and distributed software;
   designing and implementing software to increase maintainability and reuse;
   evaluating software for change;
   and validating software changes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Learning outcomes</b>:
  <ol>

  <li>Knowledge of quantitative, technical, and practical methods that software engineers and developers can use to test their software
  <li>Testing techniques and criteria for all phases of software developmentÂ—unit (developer) testing, integration testing, system testing, etc.
  <li>Theoretical and practical knowledge of how to apply test criteria to improve the quality of software
  <li>Knowledge of modern challenges and procedures to update continuously evolving software
  <li>Understanding of best quantitative programming and design practices for ensuring software can be efficiently and effectively modified and tested
  <li>Understanding that maintainability and testability are more important than efficiency for almost all modern software projects
  </ol>
