<h1>Syllabus for SWE 681 001 / ISA 681 001 - Spring 2014</h1>

<!--
<p>
<i>As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. - Maurice Wilkes (1949)<br><br></font></i>
-->

<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
GMU Catalog:
&#8220;Theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular
on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows,
race conditions and random number generation, and on identification of
potential threats and vulnerabilities early in design cycle. Emphasizes
methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security
vulnerabilities, techniques to prove absence of vulnerabilities, ways
to avoid security holes in new software, and essential guidelines for
building secure software: how to design software with security in mind
from the ground up and integrate analysis and risk management throughout
the software life cycle.&#8221;

<p>
People around the world now depend vitally on computers for their health
and well-being.
Unfortunately, this software can often be exploited by attackers,
resulting in terrible harm.
This class will study how to develop software that is far more
resistant to attack, in particular, how to prevent many vulnerabilities
from being in the software in the first place.
The goal of the class is to prepare you to be able to develop software
that is far more secure, and to
prepare you to help others do the same.

<p>
This is an extremely <i>practical</i> class.
We <i>will</i> cover theory and principles,
but we will also cover many practical specifics
so you can <i>apply</i> these principles in the real world.
If you cannot <i>apply</i> the theory, then
you understand neither the theory nor the practice.
What&#8217;s more, I want you to have experience in
trying to convince others to
<i>change</i> their behavior; that is absolutely necessary
to get more secure software worldwide.

<p>
This classes focuses on defense, not on attack.
We&#8217;ll discuss attack to some extent, but only enough to help us understand
how to defend.
Most software security problem stem from the same small set of types of
vulnerabilities (aka weaknesses),
so we will spend a lot of time learning about these common weaknesses
and how to counter them.
We will also cover general designs and techniques
for securing software designs and implementations in general, so
this is class is <i>not</i> just an enumeration of common mistakes.

I may add a few additional required reading articles as we go.

<p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to write programs.
This is a practical class for developing programs, and you&#8217;ll have a
programming project as part of the class.
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to read and understand programs in both Java and C.
The principles are language-independent, but
I have to pick <i>some</i> languages so we can discuss specific examples.
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Java and C
are two of the top programming languages according to the
TIOBE programming community index</a>;
using both lets us examine a variety of real-world issues with
widely-used languages.
In particular, C lets us examine issues that can only occur in
memory-unsafe languages (e.g., C, C++, and Objective-C), while
Java lets us examine issues that can still occur in memory-safe languages.
Some students have had success learning C simultaneously, but plan to
spend a lot of extra time if you do that.
You&#8217;ll need to be able to understand both Java and C code for
the mid-term exam, and I can&#8217;t be a language tutor.

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>

<p>
The lectures will cover the key issues and
explain some things that might not be clear otherwise.
However, you are responsible for reading and understanding the material
in the assigned readings (and not just knowing what&#8217;s in the lectures).
Note that there is a significant amount of reading, especially
in the first half of the course; we then move into more specialized
topics and application.

<p>
First actual class date is January 22, 2014;
the last class day is May 7.
The last class has a slightly different time (7:30 pm - 10:15 pm)
and will be used for final project presentations (this is the time
assigned for final examinations).
Spring break is March 10-16.
I routinely check the list of
<a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/calendar/religious-holiday-calendar/">&#8221;non-work&#8221;
religious holidays</a> maintained by GMU.
This time, Passover (Pesach), 1st two days is April 15-16.

	<td>Minor Assignment</td>
	<td>5%</td>
	<td>Pick a known vulnerability in a specific program from the <a href="http://samate.nist.gov/SRD/">NIST SAMATE Reference Dataset (SRD)</a> or similar source.  Please look at several examples before you pick one to write about (you can click on a test case id to see its specifics)! Do not just pick the first one in the list, but try to be a little more random; I do not want to read about the same one from everyone.  Then write a short (1-2 page) paper showing the vulnerable code snippet, explaining the vulnerability (where is the vulnerability? why is it vulnerable? what kind of vulnerability is it?), and explaining how it could be fixed (give specifics).  Be sure to cite your source(s).  This is intended to be an easy assignment to give you early experience looking at programs with vulnerabilities. Looking at vulnerable programs, with information on why they&#8217;re vulnerable, can help you find vulnerabilities in other programs... and is great practice for the mid-term.</td>

Please get to know your classmates so you can pick a partner you can work with.  This is a critical part of the course, because it gives you <i>experience</i> in <i>applying</i> the concepts.

<p>
Do <b>not</b> turn in materials late.  Penalty is
10%/day and they won&#8217;t be accepted after three days
(except for unexpected health/ family emergencies or <i>special</i> permission).

<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and <i>don&#8217;t distract others</i>.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate in class.
<p>
Please talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with the mid-term, your topic presentation, or final presentation,
e.g., a <a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.
I can easily reschedule topic presentations; the others are much harder.
Don&#8217;t bother telling me if you&#8217;ll miss other class times;
I strongly recommend class attendance, but I understand if
work, family, or other commitments sometimes make that difficult to do.
You can always turn in work early
(e.g., if the deadline conflicts with a religious holiday).

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
GMU is an <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>
university; please see the University Catalog for
a full description of the code and the honor committee process. The
principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations
are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this
course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&#8217;s work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance
and clarification.
<b>Do not plagiarize.</b>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Students, please use your Mason email accounts (or other GMU facilities)
to send and receive important
University information, including messages related to this class.
Please use the instructor&#8217;s email address for class questions.
If GMU&#8217;s email system messes up,
that&#8217;s GMU&#8217;s problem; if outside
emails never get to GMU (or me), that&#8217;s not GMU&#8217;s (or my) problem.
This also helps compliance with student privacy laws.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
it&#8217;s nice to let me know as a courtesy, but you must
contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 703-993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations <i>must</i> be arranged through the ODS,
not through me.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me), please bring that <i>form</i> to me.
