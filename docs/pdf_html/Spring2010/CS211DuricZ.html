<h1>CS 211 / 003 </h1>
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Monday 4:30 pm - 7:10 pm in Science and Technology I, Rm 131. 

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>
<p><h3>Teaching Assistants</h3> Sunnitha Thummala 
<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/cs211/">http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/cs211/</a>
<p><h3>Textbook</h3>
The textbook is John Lewis and William Loftus, Java Software Solutions: Foundations of Program Design, 6th ed., Adison Wesley, 2009.
<p><h3>About the Class</h3> This is the second course in programming. I will assume that students are familiar with the basics of programming, i.e. designing, coding, testing, and debugging simple programs. The language you have used in the past doesn't matter.
<br><br>We will study programming with the Java language. Emphasis will be on object-oriented thinking/design/programming. We will cover the basics of Java and discuss good programming methodology.

<p><h3>Course outcomes</h3> Upon completing the course the students
will have:
<ul>
<li>an understanding of basic object-oriented (OO) programming
  concepts and principles.
<li>an ability to apply basic object-oriented principles and
  techniques in the development of software systems using a specific
  programming language.
  <li>
an ability to effectively develop software systems using both basic
  command line tools and sophisticated integrated development
  environments, and to understand the advantages and limitations of
  each.
  <li>
an ability to successfully perform debugging operations and techniques.
<li> an ability to perform software development in both individual and team environments.
<li> an understanding of programming-related references/resources available to software developers and the ability to use them effectively â€“ both in ongoing projects and in the acquisition of new technical skills.
<li>an understanding of how acquired programming skills facilitate
  success in upper level CS courses and in various professional
  environments.
  </ul>

<p><h3>Labs</h3> Attendance at labs is <b>required</b>. A short
  programming assignment will be given at the beginning of the lab and
  the lab instructor will be available to help students with the
  programming. If not completed the lab may be taken home. Lab
  assignments will be due at the <b>beginning</b> of the following lab
  period.  <b>No</b> late lab assignments will be accepted.
<br><br>There will be occasional unannounced quizzes given in labs. A missed quiz cannot be made up. The lowest quiz score for the semester will be dropped.

<p><h3>Projects</h3>In addition to the labs there will be several larger programming projects. These will be presented and discussed in the lecture. Late projects will be accepted with a 20% per day late penalty.

<p><h3>Individual work</h3>
You are free to discuss ideas for both the labs and projects with other students, however <b>no joint work is permitted</b>. Any submitted work must be yours alone. Any work which shows too much similarity with others' submitted work will receive a grade of 0. Extreme or repeat cases may result in failing the course or referral to the Honor Commitee.
<br><br>
Read the <a
  href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS
  Department honor code</a> and the <a
  href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu">University honor code</a>. You are
  bound by these honor codes.

<p><h3>Grading</h3>In addition to the labs and projects there will be a midterm exam and a final. Grades will be computed using a weighted average of these scores with the weights:
<ul>
<li> labs: 20%
<li> quizzes: 10%
<li> projects: 25%
<li> midterm exam: 20%
<li> final exam: 25%
</ul>
  Additionally, <b>a score of 60% or better on the final exam is required to pass the course.</b>

<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you heve a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.
