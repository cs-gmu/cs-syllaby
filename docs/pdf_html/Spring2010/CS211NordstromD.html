<H3>Textbook</H3>

<P>
The textbook is John Lewis and William Loftus, <I>Java Software Solutions: 
Foundations of Program Design</I>, 6th ed., Addison Wesley, 2009.  
</P>

<H3>The course</H3>

<P>
This is the second course in programming.  I will assume that students are
familiar with the basics of programming, i.e. designing, coding, testing, and 
debugging simple programs.  The language you have used in the past doesn't
matter.
</P>

<P>
We will continue programming using the Java language.  Emphasis will be on 
object-oriented thinking/design/programming.  We will cover the basics of Java
and discuss good programming methodology.
</P>

<H3>Course outcomes</H3>
Upon completing the course the students will have:
<UL>
    <LI>an understanding of basic object-oriented (OO) programming concepts and principles.</LI>
    <LI>an ability to apply basic object-oriented principles and techniques in the development of software systems using a specific programming language.</LI>
    <LI>an ability to effectively develop software systems using both basic command line tools and sophisticated integrated development environments, and to understand the advantages and limitations of each.</LI>
    <LI>an ability to successfully perform debugging operations and techniques.</LI>
    <LI>an ability to perform software development in both individual and team environments.</LI>
    <LI>an understanding of programming-related references/resources available to software developers and the ability to use them effectively – both in ongoing projects and in the acquisition of new technical skills.</LI>
    <LI>an understanding of how acquired programming skills facilitate success in upper level CS courses and in various professional environments.</LI>
</UL> 

<H3>Labs</H3>

<P>
Attendance at labs is <I>required</I>.  A short programming assignment will be
given at the beginning of the lab and the lab instructor will be available 
to help students with the programming.  If not completed the lab may be taken
home.  Lab assignments will be due at the <I>beginning</I> of the following
lab period.  <I>No</I> late lab assignments will be accepted.
</P>

<P>
There will be occasional unannounced quizzes given in labs.  A missed quiz 
cannot be made up.  The lowest quiz score for the semester will be dropped.
</P>

<H3>Projects</H3>

<P>
In addition to the labs there will be several larger programming projects.
These will be presented and discussed in the lecture.  Late projects will
be accepted with a 20% per day late penalty.

</P>



<H3>Individual work</H3>

<P>
You are free to discuss ideas for 
both the labs and projects with other students, however
<I>no joint work is permitted</I>.  Any submitted work must be yours alone.
Any work which shows too much similarity with others' submitted work will
receive a grade of 0.  Extreme or repeat cases may result in failing the course
or referral to the Honor Commitee.
</P>

<P>
Read the CS Department honor
code: <A href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies"> 
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</A> 
and the University honor code: <A href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/"> 
http://honorcode.gmu.edu</A>.  You are bound by these honor codes. 
</P>

<H3>Grading</H3>

<P>
In addition to the labs and projects there will be a midterm exam and a final.
Grades will be computed using a weighted average of these scores with
the weights:

</P><UL>
    <LI>labs:  20%</LI>
    <LI>quizzes:  10%</LI>
    <LI>projects:  25%</LI>
    <LI>midterm exam:  20%</LI>
    <LI>final exam:  25%</LI>
</UL>
