hours; Concurrent enrollment or completion of all other general education 
requirements.  <b><br>
 <br>
 Required Textbooks: </b>Herman T. Tavani, "Ethics &amp; Technology,"  3rd 
Ed,. 2011; Maddox, Tompkins, Maddox, "Supplementary Cases and Materials," 
 2008.       
<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students become 
 effective professionals in the field of computer science by examining many 
 of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer technology 
 and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. 
 Students will examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making 
 and how to apply them to issues raised by computers and technology. Specific 
 topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns and software 
 liability issues, will be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner. 
 Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and 
 e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
       
<p>Throughout the course, students will be expected to apply critical thinking
 skills in individual and group settings to evaluate various issues related 
to computer law and ethics.  Students will connect issues of technology to 
wider societal concerns through written essays, class discussion, a mock trial,
and the creation of a hypothetical trial scenario.  Students will use critical
thinking skills to evaluate and prepare formal arguments concerning their
assigned mock trial topics, which they will present to their classmates.  Students
should be prepared to participate during class activities, to interact with
their classmates, and to reflect upon and refine their personal points of
view on various ethical issues. </p>
