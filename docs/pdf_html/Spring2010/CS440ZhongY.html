<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Overview</font></b>
<br>This course will cover the theoretical and implementation aspects 
of language processing. Emphasis will be on the techniques and the issues that arise in the design and construction of compilers. There 
are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this course.&nbsp; 
Main topics of the course include:</p>
<UL>
    <LI> Compiler Design</font></LI>
    <LI>Lexical Analysis</LI>
    <LI>Syntax Analysis - grammars, LL(1) parsers, LR(1) parsers</LI>
    <LI>Semantic Processing</LI>
    <LI>Code generation and optimization </LI>
  </UL>
  
  
  
<p><b>Course Outcomes</b><br>

<p>At the end of this course, students should
<ul>

<li>be able to compare compiled and interpreted execution models, outlining the relative merits of each.
<li>be able to describe the phases of program translation from source code to executable code and the files produced by these phases.
<li>be able to write regular expressions and finite state automata for languages, be able to use tools to automatically generate scanners.
<li>understand the definition of grammars; be able to write grammar for context-free languages; be able to manually write recursive-descent parsers; be able to transform grammars and use automatic tools to generate bottom-up parsers.
<li>be able to construct and maintain symbol table; be able to process declarations and scopes; understand the type system and type checking.
<li>be able to describe the storage system and explain the implementation of high-level language features like function calls.
<li>be able to explain the major problems and solutions of code generation; be able to implement code generator from intermediate code.
<li>be able to explain important optimization schemes; be able to describe and apply data-flow analysis.

<!--<p> <b>Class Attendance</b><br>
Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on time.&nbsp; I expect to start at 7:20 
  sharp, and possibly with a quiz!&nbsp; Please participate in class! Ask 
questions if there is something you don't understand.

<p><b>Grading Policies</b><br>
  
<ul>

<li>Tentative plans call for 3 to 4 programming assignments, together 
  worth 45% of your grade.&nbsp; These are to be <b>individual</b> efforts, meaning no sharing 
  of code allowed with anyone but the instructor or the TA. 
<li>There will also be written assignments, 
  an in-class midterm exam, a final exam and/or in-class exercises.  End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows: 

  
<ul>
    <li>55% Exercises
</li>
    <UL>
      <li>45% programming assignments
      <li>10% In-class exercises and/or quizzes
    </UL>
    <li>45% Exams 
      <UL>  
      <LI>20% midterm                 
      <LI>25% final 
    </UL>
  </ul>
  
  <!--<li>Written assignments and/or in-class exercises (15% of your grade) will be assigned periodically. Written assignments may be done individually or in groups of at most 3 people. Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day (i.e. your grade is 0 if the submission is late for 4 days).
  -->
<li>  Both the final and midterm are closed-book 
  and closed-notes. Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the 
exam.&nbsp; You must have a written excuse (doctor's note, for example) to miss an exam. &nbsp; No 
early exams will be given and make-up exams are strongly discouraged.  &nbsp;I reserve the right to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written.

<li>Letter grades will be assigned by subjectively identifying brackets 
in the numeric scores.&nbsp; <b>A total score of 49 or less will result in F</b>. 
</ul>
<p><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy</b></p>
	For programming assignments:
	<ul>
	<li>Every student has a total of <b>THREE(3) late days</b> for grace periods of the entire semester.</li>
	<li>You may use these late days on a single assignment or spread over multiple assignments.  Use them wisely.</li>
	<li>No partial late day is in effect. You need one whole late day to cover a one-hour-late submission. </li>
	<li><b>Late submissions will not be graded if you have used up all of your late days.</b></li>
	<li>You must explicitly indicate that you want to use a late day in your submission or via an email. Otherwise late submissions will not be graded.</li>
	<li>You may not give your extra late days to another student; you don't get any extra credit for having late days left at the end of the semester.</li>
	</ul>

<p><b>Extra Credit</b><br>
There may be opportunities for extra credit on some of the projects 
or exams.&nbsp; To receive any extra credit for a project, all base functionality 
of a project must be implemented; extra credit portions of a project can not count 
in place of required features.&nbsp; Extra extensions other than your late days 
will not be given for completion of extra credit. 
  
  <p> <b> <font color="#D50000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Honor Code</font></b><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are expected to abide by the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Collaboration on any programming assignment 
	is unacceptable.&nbsp; Please refer to <A HREF="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">
GMU Honor Code</A> and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
	Computer Science Department Honor Code</a>.&nbsp; Any violation of the honor code will result in a zero of the 
	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the course. 
 
  <P><font color="#0000FF">I will probably be using similarity detection software such as </font>
	<b><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">MOSS</a></b><font color="#0000FF"> to 
	detect plagiarism in programming assignments.
