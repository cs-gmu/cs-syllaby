</p><p><b>Current Catalog Description</b>
<br><b>Techniques and systems for communication of data between computational devices and layers of Internet Protocol Suite. Topics include role of various media and software components, local and wide area network protocols, network design, performance and cost considerations, and emerging advanced commercial technologies. Emphasizes TCP/IP family of protocols. </b>

<p><b>Course Outcomes</b>
<br>1. Explain basic electrical engineering principles that enable communication at the
physical layer
<br>2. Demonstrate an understanding of wired and wireless data link layer protocols for
shared medium and point-to-point communication

<br>* 40% Final exam



</p><p><b>Project: We will use the Java Network Workbench (JNW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the JNW environment, as described in the required text by Pullen.

JNW is available for download from
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets">http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets</a>.
Well commented code must be submitted for grading via an upload
webpage at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle">http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle</a>.
Additional projects will be available for extra credit. Student problems with
the project are to be addressed to the TA, who may refer them the instructor as needed. </b>
Additional project information will be found at
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/JNWS">http://netlab.gmu.edu/JNWS</a>.</b>
</p><p>


</p><p><b>Project credit breakout: JDLC1, JDLC2, JDLC3, JLAN1, JWAN2, JTRN1, JTRN2 five
points each; extra credit assignment to be announced.</b>
</p><p><b>Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam
date.</b>
</p><p><b>Assignments are due by 19:30 on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit. No project submission will be accepted after last lecture day (5/3/2010).</b>
</p><p><b>All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
elaborated for Computer Science</a>. Students should be aware that their
submissions may be checked by plagiarism detection software.</b>
</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (but not higher than) A&nbsp; 93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B- 80; C 70.</b>
</p><p><b>Extra credit is available by doing an extra project; however, no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.</b> <br>&nbsp;
