		</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		<p>SWE 645 covers some of the topics related to the software
		development models that are used to support component-based software
		systems. We will be studying the software design and development side
		of component-based software.</p>
		<p>This course will take advantage of the online collaboration
		tool known as <b> <a href="https://courses.gmu.edu">Blackboard</a></b>.
		The Blackboard application (<b><a href="https://courses.gmu.edu">https://courses.gmu.edu</a></b>
		) will be used as a way to collaborate around course content, and
		sending out information. All of the class slides will be accessible
		from Blackboard, as well as the homework assignments. I will be
		posting suggestions, hints, and helpful links from time to time. Also,
		if you have questions regarding the class material, or assignments,
		please post them in the discussion forum. Many students may have the
		same questions, or could use the information that I give in my
		response. Students may also answer questions and help other students
		through the forums. So it can be very helpful. I will check the boards
		on a regular basis and respond accordingly. It is in your best
		interest to log into Blackboard as soon as possible to verify that you
		are able to reach the class material. If you have any problems using
		the Blackboard application, please contact their support team at
		courses@gmu.edu. Refer to the <a href="https://courses.gmu.edu">Blackboard
		home page </a> for more information.</p>
		<p>Though SWE 619 is the only required prerequisite, other topics
		such as web based Java programming (<a
			href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a>, <a
			href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>, <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.jsp">Servlets</a>, <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JSPs</a>,...) and database
		programming (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/overview.html">JDBC</a>)
		are going to be used throughout this course. Therefore, background
		knowledge will be helpful. SWE 642, though not a required
		prerequisite, is a great background course for these topics. The class
		will be very practical (how to build things) and require extensive
		programming assignments.</p>

		<div class="headerText">Homeworks:</div>

		<div class="sectionText">
		<p>A number of homework assignments will be given. I will discuss
		each in class and make the assignment available on the <a
			href="https://courses.gmu.edu">Blackboard</a> web site. You will
		submit your solutions using the <a href="https://courses.gmu.edu">Blackboard</a>
		application.</p>
		<p>You solution should contain a zip file containing all of your
		code and a readme file detailing any installation procedures, or
		dependencies. I reserve the right to deduct points if the readme
		and/or zip file is not included with the homework. Please read ALL of
		the assignment requirements, as they will contain important
		information, such as procedures, naming conventions, and how the
		assignment should be deployed. Points can, and will, be deducted from
		the assignments if it doesn't work, or if the source code is not
		supplied. Please review your submission before you submit it. <br />

		Be sure that you are able to access <a href="https://courses.gmu.edu">Blackboard</a>,
		as refinements and hints for the assignments will be posted there. <b>Changing
		an assignment after the due date without prior permission will be
		treated as a late submission.</b> Late submissions carry an automatic 10
		percent deduction in grade for each week that it is late. Late
		assignments w ill not be accepted after 2 weeks. No homeworks will be
		accepted after the start of the last lecture on Week 14 (12/08/2010).</p>

		<p>Assignments will be graded on the correctness of the code and
		the adherence to the requirements. A more detailed description on the
		homework grading will be included with the homework requirements when
		assigned.</p>

		<p>Since we will be focusing our efforts on EJB 3.0, it would be a
		good idea to be consistant with the software versions that will be
		used in class. Currently we will be using Java 6 and Jboss 5.1. It
		is your responsibility to have the homework assignments in working
		order. George Mason offers a JBoss application server to SWE 645
		students as a convenience. However, this is merely a convenience and I
		expect assignments to be completed on time, regardless of the status
		of the George Mason server. I also expect to be able to deploy your
		assignment on my local laptop. I highly recommend downloading and
		installing the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/">JBoss
		Applcation Server</a> on your own computer, so that you can still complete
		your assignments, even if your application server, or Internet
		connection, is down.</p>

		<div class="headerText">Honor Code Statement:</div>

		</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		<p class="p1"><span>As with all GMU courses, SWE 645 is
		governed by the GMU Honor Code. In this course, all assignments,
		exams, and project submissions carry with them an implicit statement
		that it is the sole work of the author, unless joint work is
		explicitly authorized. Help may be obtained from the instructor or
		other students to understand the description of the problem and any
		technology, but the solution, particularly the design portion, must be
		the student's own work. If joint work is authorized, all contributing
		students must be listed on the submission. Any deviation from this is
		considered an Honor Code violation, and as a minimum, will result in
		failure of the submission and as a maximum, failure of the class.
		Honor code violation may include, but are not limited to the following
		examples:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Copying answers from other students during exams.</li>
			<li>Submitting homework that is not your own work.</li>
			<li>Copying and pasting someone else's code into your own files
			(even with slight modifications)</li>

		</ul>
		<p>The examples I show in class can be used to grow on, not to
		copy. I understand that in the real world, software reuse is
		considered the norm, and can drastically improve a projects schedule.
		However, in this class, software reuse will be considered an Honor
		Code violation, unless permission is granted before the project is
		submitted. When in doubt, ask me? It is better to find out what I
		would consider a violation before the assignment is submitted. This is
		not the real world, and one of the requirements to passing this class
		is that you, the student, can handle the material on your own.</p>
