<DT>OBJECTIVE: <!-- From the catalog -->
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify"><!-- Use DIV because <P> puts in extra lines -->
  This course teaches students how to develop software for web applications.
  The concepts of client-server computing,
  theories of usable graphical user interfaces,
  and models for web-based information retrieval and processing
  are covered.
  In the past few years,
  the way software is built has been rapidly changing.
  As use of the world wide web has shifted
  from information presentation
  to information gathering
  to direct customer sales (e-commerce)
  and to business-to-business e-commerce (b2b),
  the amount and complexity of software has steadily been increasing.
  At the same time,
  new models of programming
  and new technology for designing and developing the software
  has made this complex software easier to build.
  As a result,
  there are many opportunities for personnel that have a light background
  in Computer Science theory,
  but a solid level of knowledge of software and web-based technology.
  Thus, the topic of this course is of interest to and accessible to
  students in a wide variety of specializations.
</DIV>

<P>
<DT>CONTENT:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
  SWE 432 covers
  some of the topics related to the
  exciting new programming models that are used to support
  web and e-commerce applications.
  We will be studying the software design, interface design,
  and development side of web applications.
  Programming skills are required and
  students are expected to learn HTML on their own.
  The class will be very practical (how to build things)
  and require extensive small programming assignments.
</DIV>

<P Align="justify">
  Goals are to
  understand how to design usable software interfaces
  and implement them on the web,
  learn how to build software that accepts information from users across
  the web and returns data to the user,
  and
  understand how to interact with database engines to
  store and retrieve information.
  Topics included are
  web site usability,
  client side programming,
  server side programming,
  and web site management.
  Programming approaches include Java applets, CSS, PHP,
  Javascripts, Java servlets, JSP, XML, and JDBC.
</P>

<P>
<DT>READING:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
   We will read from <B>the texts</B>, various sources on the web,
   and transparencies that will be made available on the web site.
   
</DIV>

<P>
<DT>HOMEWORKS:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
   Weekly, relatively simple, homework assignments will be given.
   I will discuss each in class and make the assignment available
   on the class web site.
   You will submit your solutions by placing them on your web sites.
   Please also bring a paper copy of your homework to class.
   This will serve as a "token" for recording and subsequently verifying scores.
   Homeworks must be submitted <U>before class</U> on the day it is due.
   </FONT></B>
   Late submissions are not accepted.
  (See the "Homework/Quiz Drop Policy" below).
</DIV>
<P>
<DT>QUIZZES:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">

  Each class (except the first one) will begin with a short quiz.
  There are no makeup quizzes. 
  (See the "Homework/Quiz Drop Policy" below).
</DIV>

<P>
<DT>HOMEWORK/QUIZ DROP POLICY:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
   The lowest three (3) homework scores and quiz scores
   are dropped.
   I anticipate 13 homeworks and 13 quizzes.
   The top 10 of each count towards the final grade.
</DIV>
 

<P>
<DT> HONOR CODE STATEMENT:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
   As with all GMU courses,
   SWE 432 is governed by the <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/unilife/honorcode.html">GMU Honor Code</A>.
   In this course, <B>all</B> assignments, exams, and project submissions
   carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the author,
   unless joint work is explicitly authorized.
   Help may be obtained from the instructor or other students to understand
   the description of the problem and any technology,
   but the solution, particularly the design portion,
   must be the student's own work.
   If joint work is authorized,
   all contributing students must be listed on the submission.
   Any deviation from this is considered an Honor Code violation.
   See the GMU Honor code for procedures in the case of a suspected violation.
</DIV>

<P>
<DT>GRADING POLICIES:
<DD>
<UL>
   <LI>Homework (total 30%).
   <LI>Quiz (total 30%).
   <LI>Closed book, in-class, comprehensive final exam (40%).
</UL>


<P>
<DT>GTA:
<DD>
<DIV Align="justify">
   The GTA for this class is Bhargava Bulusu, who may be contacted at
   <A HREF="mailto:bbulusu@gmu.edu">bbulusu@gmu.edu</A>.
   TA has office hours  in ENGR 4456.
   The GTA room may be subject to change; I suggest checking prior meeting.
</DIV>

<P>
<u>ABET COURSE OUTCOMES</u><br>
   1. Understand how to design usable software interfaces and implement them on the web
