<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide senior CS majors an
opportunity to work on a semester-long&nbsp; project that is more
substantial than the projects typically assigned in a course.<br>
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Grade of C or better in CS 310, CS 330 and CS 367. Senior status.<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOTE: Prerequisites will be
enforced </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">strictly</span><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">.</span><br>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
It is expected that students will work in teams (with 3 to 5 students
per team) on a software development project. However, this rule may be
relaxed depending on the enrollment in the class and the interests of
the students. Thus, for example, a student could work on a
research-oriented project where the focus is less on software
development and more on solving the research issue under consideration.<br>
<br>
The topic of the project will decided by each student team in
consultation with the course instructor. Students are free to propose a
project in their area of interest, as long as the topic is approved by
the course instructor. <br>
<br>
While the course instructor is responsible for monitoring the progress
of each project, students can do their project under the supervision of
any faculty member in the CS department. Thus, for example, students
interested in doing a project in robotics would need to find a faculty
member who works in robotics to guide their project.&nbsp; For the
research interests and expertise of CS faculty members,&nbsp; see
http://www.cs.gmu.edu/research/ and http://www.cs.gmu.edu/faculty/<br>
