	<h3>HOW TO CONTACT</h3>
	<p><a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2016/cs211/home">Piazza</a> is the central site for our announcements, documents repository, and discussion board. The announcements and discussion board are part of the <i>required reading</i> for the course. All instructors and TAs can view all material on Piazza. <b>Do not</b> e-mail course staff about programming problems; use the discussion board.</p>
	<p><b>Email</b> course staff only for <b>logistical issues</b> such as meeting outside of office hours, missing lab/lecture, grading disputes, medical situations, etc.  Email addresses are listed on Piazza.</p>
	<p><a href="http://mymason.gmu.edu">BlackBoard</a> is used for project submission and to post grades.</p>

	<h3>TEXTBOOK</h3>
	<p>Required: Building Java Programs, 3rd ed., by Reges and Stepp.</p>
	<p>Recommended: Lab Manual (sections will be posted online on the course Piazza site for free download). 

	<h3>SOFTWARE &amp; PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<p>You will need a computer for this class with some modern operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember that lab computers are also available on campus, see campus resources below.</p>
	<p>The prerequisite for this course is CS 112 or its equivalent with a grade of C or better. I will assume a "semester's worth" of programming experience. You should understand basic programming including program design, coding, and debugging techniques.</p>

	<h3>COURSE OUTCOMES</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>An understanding of basic object-oriented (OO) programming concepts and principles.</li>
		<li>An ability to apply basic object-oriented principles and techniques in the development of software systems using a specific programming language.</li>
		<li>An ability to effectively develop software systems using both basic command line tools and sophisticated integrated development environments, and to understand the advantages and limitations of each.</li>
		<li>An ability to successfully perform debugging operations and techniques.</li>
		<li>An ability to perform software development in both individual and team environments.</li>
		<li>An understanding of programming-related references/resources available to software developers and the ability to use them effectively – both in ongoing projects and in the acquisition of new technical skills.</li>
		<li>An understanding of how acquired programming skills facilitate success in upper level CS courses and in various professional environments.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>CLASS COMPONENTS & REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lectures - During lectures we will discuss programming concepts and provide demos of programming relevant to other course work. </li>
		<li>Labs - Labs meet once per week and attendance is required. Labs roughly alternate between Exercises and Quizzes/Tasks. Lab exercises are open resource and open collaboration. Lab Quizzes and Tasks are closed resource, no collaboration allowed.</li>
		<li>Readings - Associated with lab are readings from the Lab Manual posted online. It is assumed that students read the scheduled lab manual sections prior to each lab; doing so will make it relatively easy to complete the labs during the allowed time.</li>
		<li>Office Hours - In addition to attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you learn.</li>
		<li>Programming Assignments -  Students will receive a number of programming projects during the semester. Each project will involve writing programs and answering questions about them to illustrate an understanding of course material.</li>
		<li>Exams - There will be two midterm exams during the course during the regularly scheduled lecture time. There will also be a comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester. Refer to the schedule for dates of the exams.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>FINAL GRADES</h3>
	<p>Final grades will be assigned without rounding according to the following criteria. It is a 10-point scale per letter grade, with the upper and lower 2% of each 10% earning a + or -. For example:</p>
	<table border=1 style="border-collapse: collapse">
		<tr>
			<th>Letter Grade</th>
			<th>Score Required</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A+</td>
			<td>98% and up</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A</td>
			<td>92-97%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A-</td>
			<td>90-91%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B+</td>
			<td>88-89%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B</td>
			<td>82-87%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B-</td>
			<td>80-81%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C+</td>
			<td>78-79%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>72-77%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C-</td>
			<td>70-71</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>D</td>
			<td>60-69%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>below 60%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Note: per departmental policy, a failing grade on the final exam (&lt;60.0%) will result in a failing grade (F) for the entire course, regardless of performance on other assignments and graded materials.</p>
	<p>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.</p>
	
	<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h3>
	<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions. The work you submit should be the product of your own effort and reflect your personal understanding.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code or exam solutions they submit. Inability to do so will be construed as evidence of misconduct.</p>

	<p>Both the University and the Computer Science Department have honor codes you are expected to adhere to. We will be reviewing these in class, but more information about the university honor code can be found here: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/</a> and the deparment's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>. You are bound by these honor codes.</p>
	<p>Any submitted work which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors Committee. Any code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the project may be included in your programs.</p>
