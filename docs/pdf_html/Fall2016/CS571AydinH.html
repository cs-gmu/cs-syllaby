<b>Course Home Page:</b>
Throughout the term, all course material (announcements, slides, handouts, etc.) will
  be available on the <a href="http://mymason.gmu.edu">GMU
Blackboard system </a> </P> 

  
<p>

<p>
The students must achieve a total score of at least 85 (out of 100) to be considered for an A. No early midterm/final exams will be given and make-up
exams are strongly discouraged.&nbsp; A
student should present an official and verifiable excuse to miss a midterm/final exam (such
as a doctor's note). A total score less than 50 or a final exam
  score less than 40 will result in F.  
  <p>
All exams are closed book.  The final exam will be cumulative; that is, it
  will include all topics discussed during the term. The students are responsible for keeping back-ups of their work
  while they are working on an assignment. <p>

<p>
All students must abide by the <a
href="http://catalog.gmu.edu/content.php?catoid=5&amp;navoid=410#Honor">GMU
Honor Code</a> and <a
href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code">CS
Department's Honor Code and Academic Integrity Policies</a> during the
semester. The students are supposed to work <i>individually </i>on the
assignments. Collaboration will be allowed only for the group
assignments, within each group. We reserve the right to use automated tools such
as <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS</a> to detect plagiarism.
Violations of the Honor Code will result in an
F. Those violations will be also reported to the GMU Honor Council. </p>



<p>
<b>Computer Accounts:</b> 
All students should have accounts on the VSE Unix cluster 
(aka zeus.vse.gmu.edu). Instructions and related links can be found <a
href="http://labs.ite.gmu.edu/index.php/FAQ/ClusterAccount">here.</a> 
</p> 


  <p>
<B>Classroom Behavior:</b>
During the lectures, the students should avoid behavior that may
  distract others, including chatting, sleeping, playing games,
  surfing the web. All electronic communication devices (including
  laptops, PDAs, cell phones) should be either turned off or silenced
  during the lectures. The use of electronic devices (including
  laptops and tablet computers) is allowed only for course-related
purposes, such as note taking.

<p>
<b>Disability Statement:</b> If you have a learning or physical
  difference that may affect your academic work, you will need to
  furnish appropriate documentation to GMU Disability Resource Center.
If you qualify for accommodation, the DRC staff will give you a form
detailing appropriate accommodations for your instructor. If you have
such a condition, you must talk to the instructor <U> during the first
week of the term </U> about the issue.
