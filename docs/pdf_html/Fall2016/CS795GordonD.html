  <h2 class="title">Course Overview</h2>
  <h3>Course Description</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
      The course will provide an introduction to modern cryptography.
      We will cover many practical topics, such as how to correctly
      use block ciphers and hash functions for the most common tasks:
      encryption and message authentication.  In addition, with what
      time we remains, we will also cover several recent topics in
      cryptography, such as the use of block chains for crypto
      currencies, data sanitization through differential privacy, and searching encrypted databases. </p>
      
    <p> <em><strong>Objectives</strong></em><br>
      The main objectives are to convey the importance
      of <em>provable</em> security, to teach students how to use
      cryptographic tools in a way that is provably secure, to
      provide students with the ability to decide whether a
      protocol is secure, and to demonstrate the range of what can be
      achieved with provable security.  </p>

    <p> <em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
      There are no formal prerequisites for this course, and I intend
      for everything to be self-contained. However,
      students should have some level of mathematical
      maturity. Accordingly, a
      course such as CS600 would be a good course to take prior to
      this one.  Students should be comfortable proving that one
      computational task reduces to another (in a formal way), and
      they should have comfort with basic probability theory.   </p>

    </blockquote>

  <h2 class="title">Course Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There will be 6 homework assignments, due every other week.
    Students are welcome to work in groups, but <em>every student
    must write their solutions independently.</em>  Homework that
    appear overly similar will be considered to violate the honor
    code. Students may re-submit up to 3 homework assignments for re-grading.
    The intent is to encourage students to revisit material that they
    did not understand; students are discouraged from re-submitting
    homework to save a few points.  Accordingly, the following rules
    apply: <br> a) Points earned on re-submissions will be earned at 80%
    value: if you lost 5 points on the first submission, you can
    earn back at most 4. <br>b)
    Before resubmitting a homework, you must attend office hours to
    discuss what you didn't understand.  <br> c)
    Re-submissions are due two weeks after the graded homework was
    originally returned to the student. <br> d) Anything submitted for re-grading must be accompanied by the
    original submission.  </p>
    <p>I encourage students to type their answers, both because they
    will be easier to read, and also because I believe it helps you clarify your
    own thinking.  You can use
    this <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~gordon/teaching/cs600/solutions.tex">LaTex
    template file</a>, if it is helpful to you.  There are also command
    definitions that might be helpful
    to
    you <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~gordon/teaching/cs600/sol_preamble.tex">here</a>.
    (If you're using the template file, you will need to 
   remove the comment where the preamble file is included.) This is a
    great
    LaTex <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">reference</a>,
    with a list of useful symbols on page 75. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     There will be one mid-term and one final exam. Each will cover
     roughly half of the semester.  The final will not be
     cumulative.  Both exams are closed book, and no notes will be
     allowed. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <h3>Grading</h3>
  <blockquote> <p>Homework: 50%  <br>Midterm: 25% <br> Final:
	  25%</p></blockquote>
       <h2 class="title">&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 class="title">Course Policies </h2>
  <h3> Laptops </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I prefer that students do not use laptops in class.  I will go
    slowly enough that notes can be taken by hand.  If you feel you need
    a laptop, please discuss it with me.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Tentative Schedule</h2>
  The following schedule is tentative, and is likely to change.
  Please go <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~gordon/teaching/grad_crypto/syllabus.html">here</a> for a
  schedule that is updated weekly to reflect what we actually cover,
  and to find reading and homework assignments.
