</li>
</ul>
	

	
	<h3> Textbook </h3>
    
	<p>Required: Building Java Programs, 3rd ed., by Reges and Stepp.</p>
	<p>Recommended: Lab Manual (sections will be posted online on the course Piazza site for free download).</p>
	
		<h3>Computing</h3>
<p>
It is assumed you will have access to a computer with the ability to
edit, compile, and run Java programs.  Some university labs provide
this ability. If you have difficulty accessing a
suitable environment, contact the course staff.
</p>
	
	<h3> Coursework</h3>
	<div>
<div>
<h4> 1. Lectures</h4>
<p>
During lectures we will discuss programming concepts and instructors
will provide demos of programming relevant to other course work.
Programming labs will be for students to work on additional exercises
and get immediate help from teaching assistants. In addition to
attending the regular meeting times, you are strongly encouraged to
visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to
further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you
learn.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4> 2. Textbook Readings</h4>

<p>
Readings from the textbook relevant to each lecture are listed in the
schedule.  You will increase your understanding of lectures by reading
associated textbook sections ahead of time, though this is not
assumed.  We may provide additional reading material to supplement the
textbook which will be posted on the course web page.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4> 3. Labs</h4>

<p>
Labs meet once per week and attendance is required.  Labs roughly
alternate between <b>Lab Exercises</b> and <b>Lab Quizzes/Tasks</b>.
</p>

<p>
Associated with lab are readings from the Lab Manual posted
online. It is assumed that students read the scheduled lab manual
sections prior to each lab; doing so will make it relatively easy to
complete the labs during the allowed time. <b>This is one of our main
sources of practice</b>. If you don't practice, you won't succeed.
</p>
<div>
<h5>Lab Exercises</h5>
<p>
About half of labs will involve Lab Exercises.  These are short sets
of programming problems which are designed to be completed during the
lab time so long as students have kept up with reading and lectures.
Teaching Assistants will give a brief introduction to the problems and
then be present to assist as students work on the exercises.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab exercises are open resource and open collaboration.</b> Students may
freely discuss how to solve the exercises with anyone, examine each
other's code, assist one another in debugging, and employ any online
or physical resources to complete the exercises.  No penalties will be
assessed for similar looking code on Lab Exercises.
</p>


<h5>Lab Quizzes and Tasks</h5>
<p>
About half of labs will involve either a Lab Quiz, a set of paper and
pencil questions, or a Lab Task, a programming task on a
computer. <b>Lab Quizzes and Tasks are closed resource, no collaboration
allowed.</b> For Lab Tasks, students may use their own programming
environment and submit their solutions to Blackboard by the end of the
lab. No external resources may be used for Tasks.
</p>

<p>
Students will take the Quiz or Task in the lab room and be monitored
by teaching assistants.  All materials must be submitted by the end of
the lab period according to the instructions associated with the
assessment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h4> 4. Programming Projects</h4>
<p>
Students will receive a number of programming projects during the
semester.  Each project will involve writing programs and answering
questions about them to illustrate an understanding of course
material.
</p>

<p>
Each programming project will have an "Honors Problem" which honor
section (H01) students must complete.  Other sections are not required
to do these sections and will not receive any credit for completing
them but are free to try. The normal projects will normally be scored
out of 100 points, and earning 100 points would be a perfect
score. The honors problem will be some additional amount of points. If
a particular project had a 15 point honors problem, then they would
need 115 points to get a perfect score. Disregard blackboard's "points
possible" claims if it doesn't match your style of section.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4> 5. Exams</h4>
<p>
There will be two midterm exams during the course during the regularly
scheduled lecture time.  There will also be a comprehensive final exam
at the end of the semester.  Refer to the schedule for dates of the exams.
</p>

	<p>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.</p>
	
	<p>Final grades are calculated on a 10-point scale per letter grade, with the upper and lower 2% of each 10% earning a + or -.</p>

	<h3> Honor Code </h3>
	<p>All students are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">GMU Honor Code</a> and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS Department's Honor Code </a> policies. This policy is rigorously enforced. All class-related assignments are considered individual efforts unless explicitly expressed otherwise (in writing). Review the university and department honor code and present any questions regarding the policies to instructor. Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code.</p>
	
	<h3> Disability Accommodations </h3>
	<p>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented with <a href = "http://ds.gmu.edu/">GMU Office of Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance should speak with me ASAP to discuss accommodations.</p>
