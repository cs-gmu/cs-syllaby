    <p><b>DESCRIPTION: </b>CS 100 is intended to help students learn to think
      in the manner necessary to fully grasp the nature and power of the digital
      world around us. The early era of the Internet and the personal computer
      lead to the need for "computer literacy." Now, the changing nature of our
      global society requires that students learn new ways to think about
      problems and how to solve them, regardless of students' specific fields of
      endeavor. Through this course, students will explore major issues related
      to the "big ideas" of computational thinking (namely, (i) Creativity, (ii)
      Abstraction, (iii) Data, (iv) Algorithms, (v) Programming, (vi) Internet,
      and (vii) Societal Impact), as well as how these issues will impact their
      future lives.</p>

            information security, how to take precautions and use techniques and
            tools to defend against computer crimes.</li>
          <li>Students will recognize the significance of the "big ideas" of
            computational thinking.</li>

    <p>This course fulfills the Mason Core requirement in information
      technology.</p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TRANSLATION OF THE ABOVE:</span> This class
    will give you some idea about how computers work, why we as a society use
    them, and the problems that can occur with and/or without them. It will also
    discuss current trends in computing technology and give some insight into
    what people in the computer science and software fields need to do in order
    to use computers to solve problems. You will be introduced to basic building
    blocks for computers and programs and you will "get your hands dirty" by
    creating your own algorithms and computer programs. The course will also
    give an overview of the history of computing from ancient times to the
    present day.<br>
    <p><i>Prerequisite: None.</i> </p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>TEXTBOOK: &nbsp; </b>There is no required textbook to purchase.
      Readings will be assigned via various sources, such as internet articles,
      and freely available downloadable textbooks.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

    <p> <b>COURSE POLICIES</b> </p>
    <p><i>Class:</i> Class lectures will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from
      12:00 - 1:15 p.m. Students are expected to attend the full lecture each
      week and are responsible for all material covered during lecture.</p>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Electronic Devices:<span style="font-style: italic;">
          &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>Use of
      electronic devices (including laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.) is
      strongly discouraged during class, except during selected group work
      exercises. &nbsp;Please make sure all such devices are turned off or
      silenced while class is in session. </p>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Computing Resources:</span>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);">You
        are required to have access to an internet enabled computer. Some
        university labs provide computers for this purpose but most students
        find it more convenient to have a personal computer. Some lecture time may
        be devoted to showing the use of online applications. If it will be
        difficult for you to gain access to computing resources, contact the
        instructor.</span></p>
    <p><i>Programming Assignments:</i> There will be several small programming
      assignments throughout the semester. You will use an online compiler to
      write, compile and run your programs. Grading rubrics will usually be
      provided and should be consulted to ensure that assignment specifications
      are met. If your program is incomplete or does not run correctly, you may
      still submit it for partial credit. However, your code must have the
      ability to run completely without obvious errors, even if all
      functionality given in the specifications are not present. Your TA relies
      on running your program as part of your grade determination.&nbsp; <b>Therefore,
        any programming assignment that is submitted but either does not compile
        or has major errors when it is run will receive no more than 50% credit.</b>
    </p>
    <p>Students are expected to work independently outside of class to
      familiarize themselves with the GMU computer systems, to read and review
      all assigned materials and to complete all homework and programming
      projects.</p>
    <p>Generally, programming assignments will be individual effort (i.e. no
      collaboration with other students). Occasionally, group programing
      assignments may be assigned. </p>
    <p><i>Reading</i>: Students are responsible for reading and understanding
      all assigned material. Be aware that some material covered in class may
      not be found in the assigned readings. &nbsp;If you do not understand any
      of the covered material or reading assignments, ask questions in class, on
      Blackboard or during GTA/instructor office hours. </p>
    <p><i>Due Dates</i>: Due dates for all assignments will be posted on
      Blackboard. Assignments are posted in advance, and are due in the manner
      stated in the assignment (either electronic submission through Blackboard
      or in class) no later than the date specified.&nbsp;</p>
    <hr><b>GRADING POLICY</b>
    <p>Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following items: </p>
    <ul>
      <tt>
        <li>Class Participation/Instructor Evaluation (10%)</li>
        <li>Assignments (homework, programs) (40% total)</li>
      </tt> <tt>
        <li>Quizzes/Mini Exams (30%)</li>
      </tt> <tt> </tt> <tt>
        <li>Final Exam (20%)</li>
      </tt>

        assignments will be a mixture of problem solving, writing English
        responses to questions, and writing code. Some HW will be individual
        effort and other HW may be done in groups of a limited size.<br>
      </span></p>
    Quizzes and/or "Mini Exams" will be given periodically throughout the
    semester. Usually (but not always) they will be announced ahead of time.
    Announced exams will generally be worth more to the overall average than
    unannounced exams.<br>
    <p>Class Participation and Instructor Evaluation may include in-class
      exercises.</p>
    <hr><b>CLASS COMMUNICATIONS</b>
    <p>CS 100 will use Blackboard and GMU email for most class communications.
      We will also be using Piazza for questions on assignments. &nbsp;You are
      responsible for any announcements or information posted on Blackboard or
      Piazza, either by your instructor or your GTA. &nbsp;Since most Blackboard
      announcements will also be sent to your GMU email account, please make
      sure your GMU email account is active and able to receive messages.&nbsp;
      Individual communications with the professor/GTA should also use&nbsp;your
      GMU email account. When you send email, please be sure to include your
      name, the class number and section and the topic in the subject header.
