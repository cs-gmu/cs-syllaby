    <p><b>&nbsp;Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help
      students become effective professionals in the field of computer science
      by examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding
      computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing
      with those challenges. Students will examine the philosophical bases for
      ethical decision-making and how to apply them to issues raised by
      computers and technology. Specific topics covered in CS 105/110, such as
      intellectual property concerns, will be addressed by this course in a more
      intensive manner. Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the
      computer profession and e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is
        a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much of
        our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
        dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
        chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
        apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
        opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
        may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
        and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that you
        will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU
          are the most important component of this class, so please come
          prepared to think, discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At
          the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you
          disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>
    <p align="justify"><b>Course Outcomes:</b></p>
    <ol>

        computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.</li>

        and societal concerns using perspectives of law, ethics and computer
        science.</li>

        Requirements:&nbsp; All Fall, 2023 CS 306 classes are being offered
        in-person, so we will not be offering any online synchronous class
        sessions.&nbsp; However, all students will have certain asynchronous
        requirements as well as many materials and assignments that will require
        BB access to complete. </b>Accordingly, all students will need to be
      prepared for the following technology requirements to successfully
      complete this class:
      <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
        <ul>
          <li>a device and regular Internet access capable of regularly
            accessing Blackboard class materials</li>
          <li>the use of a working microphone and webcam to complete certain

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a Writing Intensive (WI)
      Course that, together with CS 321, meets the GMU WI Requirements for the
      BS CS and BS ACS programs. Accordingly, each student in CS 306 is required
      to write a minimum of 1750 individual words, which will be graded and
      returned to the student with feedback. This requirement will be
      fulfilled&nbsp;by two essays related to law and ethics, on of which will
      require both a draft and final submission, each graded separately.&nbsp;<b><span
          style="font-style: italic;">The final version of both </span>essays&nbsp;must
        meet minimum word-count requirements <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>
        earn a final grade of C or better in order to receive a C or better in
        the course.</b> Students will also be writing an in-class essay exam and
      will work with partners to research and write materials in preparation for
      their&nbsp;Mock Trials.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Grading Policy:</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Class Participation (incl. short preparation
      assignments) (15%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Brief quizzes on assigned reading and recent lecture
      material (10%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Non-trial Discussion Board assignments (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Formal Essays (15%) &lt;Essay 1 (500 words) (5%),
      Essay 2 Draft (1000 words) (5%) and Essay 2 Final (1250 words) (5%)&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Essay "Quest" (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Mock Trial Group Project and Presentation (35%
      total)<small><br>
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Final Exam (15%) <br>
        </big></small></p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work: &nbsp;You are expected to submit
      all work by the stated due date. &nbsp;</span>Late work may be accepted at
    the discretion of the instructor, but &nbsp;will be subject to a late
    penalty, typically 5-10% per day (incl. weekends).<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;The group project is divided into several parts, and no late
      work&nbsp;will be accepted after the due date for the next sequential
      part. &nbsp;NO late work of any kind will be accepted for credit after
      Saturday, Dec. 2, 2023. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Attendance:</span>&nbsp; You should assume ALL normally scheduled classes
    are synchronous and require attendance unless specifically told
    otherwise.&nbsp; Occasional classes may be asynchronous (not requiring class
    attendance), but these will be clearly announced in advance.&nbsp; Students
    should plan to attend ALL class sessions prepared to participate and ready
    to discuss the readings assigned for that day.&nbsp; Failure to do so will
    be reflected in your class participation grade.&nbsp; (Students unable to
    attend class due to emergency or covid-19 quarantine should contact their
    instructor immediately to make special arrangements for any missed
    classes.)&nbsp; Group project grading may include a confidential review of
    participating group members by each student, and individual grades may be
    adjusted later in the semester if deemed appropriate based on repeated lack
    of participation or poor work quality as evidenced by either instructor
    observation or report by fellow group members. <b>If an assignment requires
