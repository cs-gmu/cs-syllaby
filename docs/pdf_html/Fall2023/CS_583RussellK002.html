	<div class="hidden" id="1.2">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What book will we use?</span>
			Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/">Introduction to Algorithms</a>, 2022, forth edition. ISBN: 9780262046305<br>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is the book <i>really</i> required?</span>
			Yes. Reading will be a substantial part of this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where can I get the textbook?</span>
			The university bookstore should have the book, but it's also available
			new, used, and for rent from most major booksellers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">When should I read the book?</span>
			Everyone's learning style is different, so some may prefer to 
			read the book first then come to lecture, while others may prefer to 
			hear the lecture and then read afterwards. This is entirely 
			your choice, but you do need to read as it is an integral 
			part of the course and important for fully understanding the 
			class material.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have difficulty learning from written
			material, what should I do?</span>
			If you find you have difficulty reading the textbook for some
			reason, please come talk to me! There are likely strategies
			that can make it easier (and even more enjoyable). Learning
			from written material is an important skill for all engineers,
			scientists, and programmers.

			drive (such as those available here:
			https://portableapps.com/apps), which may be helpful.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if we need to move online?</span>
			At the moment I do not foresee any movement back to all-online learning.
			However, just in case, everyone should be prepared to move online if
			the semester requires it. So please read the software/hardware
			requirements for online classes below.

	<h1>3. Semester Grades and Graded Materials</h1>
	
	<!-- **************************************************************** -->
	<h2 onclick="showHide('3.1')">3.1 Semester Grades <span style="font-size:50%">(click to expand)</span></h2>

	<div class="hidden" id="3.1">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What things will be graded?</span>
			You will be doing two main things for grades: doing homework and 
			taking exams. Homework will be weekly. Exams will be a midterm
			and a final. There is much more extensive information on these
			materials in the sections below.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How much is each task worth?</span>
			<br />The following is a breakdown of the class tasks:
			<br />
			<br />
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td valign="top"><b>Category</b> </td>
						<td valign="top"><b>Percent</b> </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td valign="top">Homework</td>
						<td valign="top">30%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td valign="top">Midterm Exam</td>
						<td valign="top">30%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td valign="top">Final Exam</td>
						<td valign="top">40%</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How do semester grades equate to letter grades?</span>
			We will be using the +/- system in the following way:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A+ (&gt;= 98.0%) A (&gt;= 92.0%) A– (&gt;= 90.0%)
				</li>
				<li>
					B+ (&gt;= 88.0%) B (&gt;= 82.0%) B– (&gt;= 80.0%)
				</li>
				<li>
					C (&gt;= 70.0%)
				</li>
				<li>
					F (&lt; 60.0%)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Do you round?</span>
			I do not round individual components (exams, homework, etc.), but 
			I do round the semester grade up to the nearest whole number before 
			determining the letter grade. Please do not ask for more rounding.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Do you curve?</span>
			I do not curve grades, and you should never ask anyone for
			a curve. A real curve pits students against each other and your grade
			might go <i>down</i> if there is someone very talented in your class.
			At its heart, a curve is a promise to fail some percentage of the
			students in the class, and I'd prefer everyone be able to pass by
			doing the work, even if everyone else is also doing the work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Ok... then do you curve <i>up</i>?</span>
			Not for the semester grades, but if I belive there is 
			something "off" about the grades on some particular assignment (based
			on my knowledge of the class in general, historical information, etc.),
			I will make appropriate adjustments to that one item.
			Please understand that all adjustments must be consistent with the
			grading shown above and <i>fair for all students</i>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I do additional work or redo assignments
			at the end of the semester?</span>
			There will be no make-up assignments or unannounced
			extra-credit opportunities at the end of the semester;
			your grade should be a measure of your semester-long progress.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I <i>need</i> to pass this class?</span>
			If you tell me at the start of the semester, we can definitely work
			together to make sure you're on track and work out any recovery
			that needs to happen if you start to struggle. Every semester I
			have one or more students who "check in" with me during office
			hours because they need the extra support, reassurance, or just
			some accountability. This is a <i>perfect</i> use for office hours.
			If you tell me at the end of the semester that you needed to pass
			but aren't currently passing, then there will be nothing I can do
			to help!

	<h2 onclick="showHide('3.2')">3.2 Homework<span style="font-size:50%">(click to expand)</span></h2>

	<div class="hidden" id="3.2">
	<p>General Homework Questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What types of homework will there be?</span>
			You will have paper-and-pencil homework each week that is due
			in class the next week. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where will I submit homework?</span>
			Homework must be submitted in person in class unless 
			you have a university excused absence and/or instructor approval.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Will you "drop" one or more homework assignments?</span>
			No. This is a graduate class. No homework can be dropped for
			any reason (except emergencies, see questions below in "Homework
			Issues and Potential Problems").
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I work in a group? Can I work with an AI?</span>
			Homework is considered <b>individual effort</b> unless otherwise
			authorized by me, and the resources permitted are only those provided
			by be. Therefore no sharing of solutons (and no discussion 
			of solutions) is allowed with anyone except the TAs and me.
			So, in short, if the person or thing helping you is not:
			(a) me, (b) an official TA for the course, (c) my course material
			-- slides, code, etc., (d) the textbook, or (e) your own brain,
			<b><i>you may not use it</i></b>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Getting Help on Homework:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">So how can I get help on homework?</span>
			Homework help is available in-person before/after class or in office
			hours, but the discussion board (Piazza) also gives a way to get
			asynchronous help. Don't spend days banging your head against a wall,
			come get help!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Where and when are office hours?</span>
			These will be posted on Piazza as either a pinned post or on the
			"Resources" page, "Staff" tab.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I discuss my homework with my classmates?</span>
			<i>Before the homework is returned for grading</i>, no. 
			<i>After the homework is returned</i>, you may discuss your
			solutions with classmates in <i><b>your</b></i> class section
			<i><b>this</b></i> semester. However, please don't give anyone a copy
			of your homework, even after grading, as you never know how they will
			use it.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How can I get getter at time management so
			I'm not doing everything at the last minute?</span>
			Instructors can often help with this, but
			<a href="https://learningservices.gmu.edu">GMU Learning Services</a>
			offers a lot of support options for time management improvement as well.
			Whatever you do, don't hide the problem, talk to someone about it!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What can I do to improve my writing skills
			(so that I don't lose points on homework or exams)?</span>
			I'd recommend working with the
			<a href="https://writingcenter.gmu.edu"> Writing Center</a>.
			They also have specific resources to assist with
			<a href="https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/for-esol-students">
				English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Homework Issues and Potential Problems</p><ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss (or will miss) a homework 
			deadline because of some sort of emergency?</span>
			If you need an extension or miss a due date because of a
			university-accepted emergency (such as being taken to the
			hospital), just notify me within 24 hours to make arrangements.
			If you provide documentation of the emergency and your involvement
			we will work out something that makes sense for the situation.
			I may elect to "exempt" a missed homework rather than give an
			extension under certain circumstances. In this case, other homework
			in the same <i>sub</i>-category will gain more weight.
			Unfortunately, to ensure the class moves forward for everyone,
			failure to follow these policies will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I miss a homework deadline
			for some other reason?</span>
			Missing a homework due date for any non-university-accepted
			reason (such as not paying attention to when the due date is),
			will result in a zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I know I will need an extension
			in advance?</span>
			Extensions require <i>exceptional</i> circumstances (as judged by me)
			and must be arranged in advance. I don't give extensions <i>on
			or after</i> the due day unless you have a university-accepted
			emergency. Normal obligations such as family or friend events,
			vacations, or other classes are <i>not</i> exceptional circumstances
			(unless hospitals are involved!).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can the TAs give me an extension?</span>
			Nope. Just me. GTAs cannot approve late submissions or extensions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>Classes with Electronic Submissions</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I submit the wrong files electronically?</span>
			Just like turning in the wrong homework in-person, turning in
			the wrong homework electronically will result in a zero. Just because it's
			easy to make a mistake, doesn't mean you shouldn't double check
			your submission (in fact, it means the opposite!).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I make a "stupid" mistake on
			my homework?</span>
			It happens, but it also has consequences. To prepare you for the
			cautiousness you need when working in a professional environment,
			you will not be able to fix <i>anything</i> after submission,
			even if it is a simple mistake. That's what the time before
			submission is for. Make sure to dedicate specific time to looking
			over your work before submission.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if Blackboard or Gradescope is down?</span>
			In the rare situation that a website/tool/service is somehow
			unavailable or giving an error, you are still responsible for 
			turning in on time. Just email your submission to me before
			the deadline and explain what happened.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if my computer crashes and I lose
			my work?</span>
			To ensure professional practices in our senior student body, 
			catastrophic computer failure will not be considered a reason
			for an extension. As this is a senior level CS course, you
			can practice the professionalism you'll need in the workplace
			by backing up your work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What type of backup should I use?</span>
			You can use online services like OneDrive (free to students, see: 
			<a href="https://its.gmu.edu/service/office-365-onedrive/">
			https://its.gmu.edu/service/office-365-onedrive/</a>), or
			something as simple as emailing things to yourself at the
			end of each day, whatever gets the job done!

		<li>
			<span class="question">What can I bring to an exam?</span>
			Exams are closed book/notes unless otherwise specified.
			Resources available during exams will be specified
			by me on a exam-by-exam basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What <i>must</i> I bring to an exam?</span>
			You will need to have your GMU identification available on

			of the exam process). Alternative <i>photo</i> IDs options
			may be required if your GMU ID is unavailable or unreadable.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I work in a group on my exam?</span>

		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I know I will miss an exam in advance?</span>
			Early or late/makeup exams require exceptional circumstances

			if the anxiety is very severe. If you have a documented anxiety disorder, then
			the third option is the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of

	<div class="hidden" id="3.4">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I contest grades?</span>
			Of course! No one is perfect. If you feel that points have been
			incorrectly deducted for any reason, just contact the grader for
			that item. For homework, that is your GTA. For exams, that's me.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is there a deadline for contesting grades?</span>
			To ensure that regrade-requests are manageable, contesting grades
			on submissions must be requested within one week of receiving the
			grade (on BlackBoard or GradeScope or in class, whichever comes first).
			No grade changes will be
			considered subsequent to that deadline or subsequent to the final
			exam (whichever comes first). For recording errors (e.g. GradeScope
			says 8/10, but Blackboard says 5/10) there is no time limit.

	<!-- **************************************************************** -->

	<div class="hidden" id="4.1">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the GMU Honor Code?</span>
			The <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU Honor Code</a>
			describes the behaviors that are not allowed in an academic setting,
			such as cheating, plagiarism, stealing, and lying. This policy is
			rigorously enforced. All students must abide by the GMU Honor Code.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the CS Honor Code?</span>
			The computer science department has a
			<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code</a>
			that you are also subject to. The document helps you to understand
			how GMU honor code applies to CS, such as what constitutes cheating
			in a CS setting, and it clarifies some scenarios that are unique to our
			sorts of assignments.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is the Honor Court?</span>
			If you are suspected of violating the GMU or CS Honor Code,
			you will be referred to the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu">
			Office of Academic Integrity</a> who will present you with
			options, such as contesting the charge or admitting the
			violation. The purpose of the honor court is to hears both
			sides in the case. This way it is
			not your professors who get to determine what occurred and
			professors can't unilaterally take action against you.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Is the Honor Court a sentencing court?</span>
			No. The honor court is there to ensure a fair hearing before
			punishments are given. The referral to the the 
			<a href="https://oai.gmu.edu">Office of Academic Integrity</a>
			is not a punishment in itself, it is a way of getting the
			situation clearly understood before any penalties are applied.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What happens if I violate the honor code
			(cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie)?</span>
			The CS Department take the honor code quite seriously. Any
			violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated.
			The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
			than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.
			<i>Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course
			failure.</i> Suspected cheating will be referred to the Honor
			Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What happens if someone steals my work?</span>
			It is your responsibility to lock your computer(s) with
			a password, to not post your work to websites like Pastebin
			that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
			computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
			computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
			your work resulting from poor computer security practices.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can you give me an example of cheating?</span>
			There are many examples in the honor codes listed above,
			if you are ever unsure of what would/wouldn't be cheating, just ask!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Why can't I do ___? I hear that's what they do
			in industry. Why is that cheating?</span>
			If you want to play in a band, you need to know how to
			play your own instrument. School is like learning to play
			the instrument, industy is like being in the band. 
			I worked for over a decade in industry, so I know what
			people do and don't do, come talk to me if you want a much
			longer discussion of this :)

	<div class="hidden" id="4.2">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I give material on Piazza/Blackboard/Gradescope/etc.
			to others?</span>
			Please don't share any course material unless you've been authorized to
			do so (by me!). There are copyright issues (and privacy issues in some
			situations) that you might not be aware of. So please ask first!
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I post course materials to the internet?</span>
			All course materials posted to Blackboard or other course sites
			are private and much of it is copyrighted. Additionally, by federal law,
			any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice,
			or image) must not be shared with anyone not enrolled in this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">Can I record the class or post recordings
			of the class?</span>
			By federal law,
			any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice,
			or image) must not be shared with anyone not enrolled in this class.
			Therefore, video recordings of in-person class meetings that include
			audio or visual information from other students is private and must
			not be shared.
			And also recordings of video conference meetings (e.g. Collaborate or Zoom) 
			that include audio or visual information from other students must 
			be viewed privately and not shared. 
			If you need to record the class due to a documented medical condition,
			you will need to sign a waiver (please ask for this).

	<div class="hidden" id="4.3">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What is your non-discrimination policy?</span>
			GMU, the CS Department, and the CS Faculty are committed to providing
			an educational environment free from any discrimination on the basis 
			of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, veteran 
			status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,

		</li>
		<li>

			If you feel there has been a violation of the University's policies on

			and Inclusion</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">What if I have a different gender identity,
			preferred name, or personal pronouns?</span>
			If you wish, please share your name and/or gender pronouns
			with us and we will attempt use them to address you in class
			and via email. In the case of a preferred name, please just 
			try to include your GNumber in communications so that we can
			easily associate you with your student record.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">How can I refer to you?</span>
			You can address any instructor as "Prof. [LAST NAME]" in email
			and verbally if you aren't sure of their personal preferences.
			"Dr. [LAST NAME]" also works for professors with PhDs.
			For me, I personally identify as female, but I dislike my gender
			being highlighted (so I dislike being called "Miss", "Mrs.", or
			"Ms.") and prefer a neutral title, such as "Prof." or "Dr.".

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I got injured and it's impacting my ability
			to do class tasks and/or homework. What should I do?</span>
			The <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability 
			Services</a> also handles services for many temporary disabilities
			(for example, if you break your arm, they can arrange note taking 
			services). Please contact them if you discover any sudden impairment 
			that affects your ability to function in class and/or on your projects. 
			They have a quick and easy registration process. All you need is 
			documentation for your condition.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have an undocumented disability,
			or other condition that impacts my learning. What should I do?</span>
			This depends a lot on the nature of your condition, but generally it's
			best to talk to someone about what's happening. Often instructors can't 
			offer support on an ad-hoc basis, but they can often help you
			determine if the situation might be helped by some coaching
			(e.g. minor test anxiety), counseling (e.g. major anxiety), or
			something you can get temporary support for from the
			<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a> (e.g.
			a broken arm).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I have a documented physical or learning
			disability. What should I do?</span>
			If you have not yet registered with the <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office 
			of Disability Services</a>, you should. This office offers
			accommodations (such as extended time on projects and/or exams,
			quite testing environments, lecture recording waivers, etc.) to
			assist with everything from broken arms to chronic/acute depression
			and anxiety. I'd highly recommend talking to them if you think any
			of their services might help. Every student I know who works with
			them speaks highly of them. They have a quick and easy registration process. All you need is
			documentation for your condition.
			Even if you don't know whether you'll
			need to use  the accommodations, it's best get your condition
			documented with the university as accommodations are not retroactive.
			
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="question">I am registered with the 
			<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services</a>, but
			I'm not sure if I want to use the accommodations. What should I do?</span>
			For all your classes (not just this one), you should still speak with
			your the instructor to discuss your approved accommodations.
			Even if you don't know whether you plan on using the accommodations, 
			once an instructor knows you have them, you can easily begin using
			them if the need arises. It's better to be over prepared than under
			prepared, since accommodations are not retroactive.
