	<h3>Course Description</h3>
	<p>
		This course presents a thorough treatment of programming according to object-oriented principles. Introduces classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and single dispatch as means to decompose problems. Covers intermediate programming techniques including error handling through exceptions, arrangement of source code into packages, and simple data structures. Intermediate debugging techniques and unit testing are covered.
	</p>

	<p><b>Outcomes</b>:
		<ol>
			<li>An understanding of basic object-oriented programming concepts and principles</li>
			<li> An ability to apply basic object-oriented principles and techniques in the design and development of software systems using a specific programming language.</li>
			<li>An ability to effectively use both basic command line tools and sophisticated integrated development environments, and to understand the benefits and limitations of each.</li>
			<li>An ability to successfully perform debugging operations and techniques.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h3>Coursework</h3>
	<p>In this course students will be evaluated using several different kinds of coursework:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Readings</b>: online textbook with interactive practice problems; weekly deadlines; automated grading.</li>
			<li><b>Class participation</b>: engaging with in class, in lab, and online activities. Contact your instructor for more details.</li>
			<li><b>Labs</b>: programming exercises during lab sessions; collaboration/group work allowed.</li>
			<li><b>Exercises</b>: small programming assignments (5-7 days); collaboration/group work allowed.</li>
			<li><b>Projects</b>: large programming assignments (10-14 days); individual work only.</li>
			<li><b>Exams</b>: in-class, individual work only.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Grading Procedures</h3>
	<p><b>Grade Distribution</b>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Coursework</th><th>Weight</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Class participation</td><td>5%</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Readings</td><td>5%</td><td>Lowest 15 subsections dropped</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Labs</td><td>15%</td><td>each week, no drops</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Exercises</td><td>9%</td><td>3% each, no drops</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Projects</td><td>21%</td><td>7% each, no drops</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Midterm exam</td><td>20%</td><td>replaced by final exam grade if final exam grade is higher</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Final exam</td><td>25%</td><td><b>must</b> pass final to pass the course</td></tr>
		</table>
	</p>
	<p><b>Grading Policies</b>
		<ol>
			<li>By department policy, students <span style="color:#ff0000">must pass the final exam with a passing grade (&geq; 60) in order to pass the course</span>.</li>
			<li>The final exam is cumulative; a higher final exam score dominates (replaces) a lower score on midterm.</li>
			<li>For projects and exercises, any number of re-submissions are allowed (the most recent is used), however a re-submission turned in after the deadline will be considered a late submission.</li>
			<li>Late submission is allowed for projects and exercises only, and only up to 48 hours.</li>
			<li>Late submission policy: Less than 24 hours is 10% off. From 24 hours to 48 hours is 20% off. More than 48 hours is 0. Submission times are automatically recorded, and there is no distinction between a 1-minute late and a 23-hours late.</li>
			<li><span style="color:#ff0000">Code which does not compile will receive a zero in most cases</span>.</li>
			<li>Save backups regularly because the unexpected happens and cannot be used as an excuse to get an extension. Save backups on a cloud service because the local file system timestamp is not acceptable.</li>
			<li>To receive a grade, the submission must be gradable. This means submitting .java source rather than compiled .class files or word documents containing the source. It also means that the code must be submitted rather than simply saved.</li>
			<li>There are no make-ups for absences to classes and labs.</li>
			<li>If you feel your assignment was graded incorrectly, let your TA and instructor know within one (1) week of when the grade was returned.</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Honor Code</h3>
	<p>
		Unless specific instructions are given to the contrary, programming assignments are an individual effort, no group work is allowed. In addition to code, this includes the sharing of test cases, pseudocode, or approaches, receiving assistance in debugging code, as well as the use of external Internet sites.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU Honor Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Department Honor Code</a> apply in this class. Any use of a direct contribution on any program, homework, quiz, or exam will be reported as a violation of the honor code.
	</p>
	<p>
		We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some kinds of participation in online study sites violate the Mason Honor code: these include accessing exam or quiz questions for this class; accessing exam, quiz, or assignment answers for this class; uploading of any of the instructor's materials or exams; and uploading any of your own answers or finished work. Always consult your syllabus and your professor before using these sites.
	</p>

	<h3>Student Resources And Accommodations</h3>
	<p>
		Students who are entitled to accommodations based on recommendations from University offices should promptly initiate a discussion with their instructors. It is the student's responsibility to acquire this information directly from the respective office.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prioritizing your well-being is paramount in achieving academic success. We strongly urge students to take advantage of the available <a href="https://advising.gmu.edu/resources/">university resources</a> designed to support their journey. We, as educators, may not possess the expertise to evaluate unforeseen and challenging circumstances that could arise; therefore, we rely on specialized offices for appropriate guidance and accommodations. These designated offices hold the responsibility of providing insights and ensuring your rights, as outlined in acts such as <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/?src=fpco">FERPA</a> or <a href="https://www.ada.gov">ADA</a>, are comprehensively understood and respected.
