</H2>

This course covers the basic principles of operating systems. Major
concepts to be discussed include processes and threads,
concurrency and synchronization, 
CPU scheduling, memory management, storage,
and file systems.

 There will be several programming projects in using the Operating
 System OS/161.  All projects will be programmed using the C language.
<b>Submission of the projects and homeworks is via the
 Blackboard</b>.

<ul>
  <li>Projects are very time-consuming, and most likely are significantly
  more time-consuming than your projects in other
  classes. You will need to understand the OS kernel code, design new
  OS features, and implement and test them!
  </li>
 
   <li>
  Each project will come with the specific instructions, as well as
  late penalty. 
  </li>

    <li>
  There is no late token. Always start your project as early as you can! 
  </li>

    <li>
  Remember to frequently backup your work. 
  </li>


   <li>
  If your code does not compile, you will get no credit.
  </li>

  <li> We reserve the right to use <a
href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">MOSS</a> and other software to detect plagiarism.</li>

<P>
Your grade will be calcuated as follows:

<UL>
<LI>30% Programming projects
</LI>
<LI>15% Homeworks assignments
</LI>
<LI>30% Midterm exams (two)
</LI>
<LI>25% Final exam (cumulative)
</LI>
</UL>


<p>Tentative dates for midterm exams and the final exam are
<b>Sept. 29th</b>, <b>Nov. 3rd</b>, and <b>Dec. 8th</b>, 1:30-4:10 pm.
All exams are closed notes, closed books.
</p>

<P>
No credit if your project does not compile.  Late homeworks/projects
will have a penalty (specified in each assignment) and will not be accepted
2 days after the due date. <b>There is no make-up for missed exams.</b>
The students are responsible for keeping back-ups of their work while
they are working on an assignment.
For group programming assignments, each member of the group must make a separate submission. If a student makes multiple submissions, only the last submission will be graded. It is critical that the students double check the files they are submitting, as submitting a wrong, corrupted, or empty file is very likely to result in a score of 0 for that assignment.
</p>

<p>If you think your work is not correctly graded then you must
initiate contact with the grader within a week of receiving the grade
(either email or on the
Blackboard). Grade contesting beyond this time window will not be
allowed. </p>

<!--
<p>Exams are closed book. The final exam will be cumulative; that is, it will include all topics discussed during the term.
No early exams will be given.  If you must miss an exam an makeup will be arranged at the discretion of the instructor, BEFORE the exam date, with a written and verified excuse.

If you have a learning or physical difference that may affect your
academic work, you will need to furnish appropriate documentation to
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu/">GMU Disability Resource Center</a>. 
If you qualify for accommodation, the DRC staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations for your instructor. If you have such a condition, you must talk to the instructor during the first week of the term about the issue.
