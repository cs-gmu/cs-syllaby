<h3>Instructions</h3>
Welcome to a new semester of exciting research seminars!  
Please read these instructions carefully, to avoid unnecessary confusion and
to ensure that you will get a passing grade at the end of the semester.
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>CS 800 is a required course</b>. The Computer Science Department considers
attending research seminars an important part of your doctoral studies, and it
thus requires every PhD student to attend research seminars, by enrolling in
its colloquium course, CS 800, <b>for two semesters</b>. This course is mandatory for PhD students, but carries zero (0) credit hours.
</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Required number of seminars</b>.  The seminars are in a wide range of subjects, and are
usually offered in the middle of the day (the starting time is usually between
10:00 am and 3:00 pm).  The frequency is not regular: in some weeks there may
be 2 or even 3 offerings, whereas in other weeks there may be no seminars at
all.  But overall, there should be sufficient offerings to meet the minimum
requirement. We have set the number of required
seminars for Spring 2022 at eight (8).
</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Eligible seminars</b>.  This is a computer science course, and generally only
computer science seminars are eligible.  Seminars offered by other departments
generally are not acceptable unless they appear in the list of
approved seminars, and exceptions should be authorized in advance
(send the instructor an e-mail).  In general, the eligible seminars will be given by
accomplished researchers (CS PhD defenses are eligible). The bottom line is that the seminar is eligible <b> only if it appears in the approved seminar list. </b>
</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Procedure</b>. During the Spring 2022 semester, we are expecting that some
seminars will be organized in-person, while some others will be
online (unfortunately we have no way of knowing how many will be
online and in-person in advance; because those  will be determined by the
organizers considering multiple factors, including the university's
pandemic-related restrictions at the event time).
You have to
attend at least eight (online or in-person) seminars during the
semester.

<br> <br> 
There is a <i>list of attended seminars </i>  form that you can download (either in pdf or MS
Word format)  from the Contents area on the Blackboard.  For every
seminar you attend and summarize, put the relevant information on the
list of attended seminars. At the end of the semester you will have to
submit the list of attended seminars form along with all the seminar
reports to the instructor. 

<br><br> 
On the list of attended seminars form, there is a line for
"Organizer's Signature". If the seminar is held in-person, you have to
get the organizer's signature on that field at the end of the
seminar.  That will be your proof of attendence for in-person
seminars.
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: You have to follow university's safety
guidelines during the pandemic when attending in-person seminars.
In addition, it is expected that in-person seminars will have
additional restructions, such as limiting the number of attendees and
requiring RSVPs. Make sure to follow those rules when attending the
in-person seminars. 

<br><br>

For online seminars, simply put "Virtual" on the signature field. At
the online seminar time,  make sure
that you connect to the virtual meeting using your full name,
including first name and last name (for instance do not use "M. Smith"
instead of "Michael Smith"). This is important for us in order to check
attendance.

Lastly, regardless of whether the talk was online or in-person,  you must <b> prepare a
report summarizing the talk </b> -- see below for details.  



<br> 
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: You can include a seminar in your list of attended
seminars from and summarize it <b> only if you
attend a seminar (almost) in its entirety</b>. If you are late to a
seminar due to unforeseen circumstances <i> by more than 10
minutes</i>, you should not include it in your end-of-semester
reports.   Failure
to follow this simple rule will be considered as an Honor Code
Violation, and the Honor Code Violation procedures will be
initiated without any exception. 


</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Reports</b>. At the end of the semester, in addition to the list of
attended seminars, each student must submit brief reports of all <b> eight (8) </b>  seminars
attended. <b>  Each report should be between 400 and 500 words</b>.  It should
summarize the subject of the seminar in no more than 100 words.
The rest (300-400 words)
should be personal review: What were the strong and/or weak points of the
research and the presentation; how in your opinion it could be applied; how it
could be expanded; etc.  Reports must be typed and written in a professional
style. In order to have a passing grade, you must attend eight seminars in
their entirety and also submit reports about all eight at the end of
the semester. 
</p>

<p>
Each report should include the title of the talk, the name of the
speaker, the date of the talk, in addition to the <b>summary </b> and
<b> personal evaluation/review </b> sections. 
Keep in mind that the <b> bulk of each report (at least 300-400 words) should
be your evaluation; the summary should be limited to 100
words.</b>  Submitting a report that violates those requirements will make
it invalid; and as a result you may receive an unsatisfactory grade.
Before submitting your reports at the end, verify the compliance with
these requirements. 


</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Start early</b>. Because of the irregular frequency of seminar offerings,
you are strongly encouraged to start attending seminars as early as possible,
so that you will not find yourself in shortage of seminars at the end of the
semester!
</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>CS Web Site</b>. The CS web site lists upcoming seminars and
events at http://cs.gmu.edu/events, which may be consulted
for upcoming events. However, recall that the event must appear in
the approved seminar list to be eligible for CS 800.
</p></li><li>
<p>
<b>Blackboard site</b>. On the CS 800 Blackboard site you will find additional announcements, the
attendance form (in both pdf and MS Word format), and a list of all the seminars that have been approved so
far.
</p></li><li>
<b>Full Semester Schedule</b>. A common question in CS 800 is the list
of all the eligible seminars that will be offered after a certain
point during the semester. Unfortunately that information is not
readily available, even to us. This is because many seminars are
organized in ad-hoc fashion and announced by various faculty at
GMU 1-2 weeks, and sometimes a few days,  prior to the actual seminar (and we cannot even tell the exact number of qualifying seminars
that will be offered; but that number will not be less than 10.) Rest
assured that we are conveying the information about
an upcoming seminar to you through the
announcements as soon as it is available. In general, the best way to
guarantee that you will have attended at least 8 seminars during the
semester is to start attending them early in the semester.  

</p></li><li>
<b>Submission of Deliverables</b>: At the end of semester, you will
receive an announcement giving the details on how to submit the
seminar reports and the form for the seminars attended during the semester. Even if you complete all the
required reports during the semester early, do not attempt to send to
the instructor by e-mail or other means at that time: <b> You need to wait till the end
of semester and then follow the instructions that will be provided at
that time.</b>  


</p></li><li>

<p>
<b>Email</b>.  We will be sending our messages to the GMU address that you were
assigned.  It is your responsibility to check this mailbox periodically, and
to ensure that mail is not rejected due to exceeded quotas.

</p></li></ol>

You should use this colloquia series to help you choose a research area, or to
expand your knowledge in your chosen research area, or simply to keep in touch
with recent developments in computer science.  You might also learn good
presentation techniques.  Don't be discouraged if you are not able to
understand every detail of a presentation; even experienced researchers are
sometimes "lost" in a difficult and unfamiliar subject.  Yet, undoubtedly your
research experience will be enriched.
