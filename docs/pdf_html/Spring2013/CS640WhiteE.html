take home portion</li>
<li> Homeworks (20%)<br>
Homeworks may be done in groups or individually.</li>
<li> Projects (40%)<br>
There will be two or three programming assignments all requiring you
to implement algorithms we are studying. These projects may assume
standard front end skills you would acquire in a class like CS 540.
Programming assignments are to be individual efforts.
