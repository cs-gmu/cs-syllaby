<h2> INFS 760: Advanced Database Management </h2>
<h4> Spring 2013 --- Prof. Ami Motro</h4>
<hr>
<p>
This is an advanced course in the area of databases, focusing on how database systems are architected and implemented to achieve essential properties such as high performance and reliability .  Whereas in an introductory course 
on databases (such as INFS 614 or CS 550) the focus is <em>how to work with
 database systems</em> (database design, query languages, application 
programming, and so on), the focus of this course is <em>how database 
systems work</em>. 
<p>
Topics to be covered include: physical data organization; query processing 
and query optimization; transaction processing, concurrency control 
and recovery; and distributed and parallel database architectures.
