<p><b>DESCRIPTION:    </b>CS 222 is a second course in computer programming,

       emphasizing programming concepts relevant to engineers. Topics include

    lower   level language aspects and elementary data structures.  Students

   are expected   to have a basic understanding of the elements of programming

   in some high-level   language.  CS 222 will be taught using C, but students

   are not presumed to  be familiar with C prior to this class.   This course

   is intended as a terminal  course in programming for engineers.</p>

                           

<p><i>Prerequisite:  C or better in CS 112.</i> </p>

                                      

<hr>                         

<p><b>COURSEWORK</b> </p>

                             

<p>Students are expected to attend all lectures each week and are responsible 

  for all material covered in the lectures. </p>

                             

<p><i>Programming Assignments:</i>  Programming assignments will be posted 

      on Blackboard as they are assigned, and must be submitted on Blackboard 

    by  the assigned due date.  If your program is incomplete, you may still 

   submit  it for partial credit.  However, <b>your code must run without 

obvious   errors  (even if not all functionality is present)</b>.  <b>Any 

programming assignment    that is submitted but either does not compile or 

has major errors when it    runs will receive no more than 50% credit.</b></p>
<p><i>Reading</i>: Students are responsible for reading and understanding

       all assigned material.    If you do not

understand    any    of the covered materal or reading assignments, there

will be opportunities       to ask questions in class, on Blackboard or during

UTA/GTA/instructor   office    hours. </p>

                             

<p><i>Due Dates</i>:  Due dates for all programming assignments will be posted

       on Blackboard.  Programming assignments are posted in advance, and

are    due  in the manner stated in the specs (usually electronic submission

through     Blackboard) no later than the date specified.  </p>

                             

<p><i>Late work</i>: Late projects will be penalized 10% per day (incl. weekend

       days/holidays).  You should recognize that this can cause major penalties

  for incomplete programs, so start work early!  There is only one submission allowed. </p>

                                      

<hr><b>GRADING POLICY</b>                             

<p>Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following items: </p>

                              

<ul>

               <tt>

  <li>programming projects (30% total)</li>
  </tt>  <tt>

  <li>class participation  (10% total)</li>

                </tt>  <tt>

  <li>midterm exam (20%)</li>

                </tt>  <tt>
                <li>final examination                (40%)</li>

                </tt>
</ul>

                              

<p>Class participation  may include in-class exercises, pop quizzes, and/or

  short programming. </p>

                             

<p> </p>

                                      

<hr><b>CLASS COMMUNICATIONS</b>                             

<p>CS 222 will be using the Blackboard system for most class communications. 

       You are responsible for any notifications or information posted on 

Blackboard      either by your instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s), and

you will  need    to check Blackboard regularly for such notices.  Some information

 may be   disseminated through Blackboard rather than in class.  Individual

 communications   with the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by email using your

 GMU email account.    When you email, please be sure to include your name,

 the class number and   the topic in the subject header.  (E.g.:  Subject:

 Jim Jones / CS 222 / Project  2) </p>

                                         

<hr>                     <b>                                             

                                               PROGRAMMING POLICIES</b> 

              

<p>(1)  <b>No sharing or discussion of code</b>.  Unless specifically stated

       otherwise, all assignments are individual projects, not group projects.

     Students  are expected to do their own work, not to share programs with

   each  other,  nor copy programs from anyone else.  This means you may

not    discuss  program  design or strategize solutions with anyone except

your   instructor  or a course  UTA or GTA.<b>  </b>However, you may offer

more  limited assistance  to your  fellow students regarding specific questions

 on their programming  assignments  by responding to queries on Blackboard.

  Any sharing of code  or discussion  of programming projects, except within

 the parameters of Blackboard,  constitutes  an honor code violation.  Suspected

 honor code violations are  taken very seriously, and will be reported to

the Honor Committee. (See CS  Department Integrity Statement and Honor Code)

</p>

                             

<p>(2)  <b>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</b><i>.</i> 

       You may <u>not</u> incorporate code written by others, such as can 

be   found on  the  Internet or any of the numerous CS books available.  You

may  freely use any  code provided as part of the project specifications,

  without  any need for  crediting the source.  However, if you use code

provided   by  your instructor  (other than that given as part of the project

specifications)     or from the  course textbook, you must document what

portion came from  those   sources. </p>

                             

<p>(3)  <b>Blackboard</b>.  We encourage the use of Blackboard to discuss

       assignments and assist one another with programming questions.  You

 may    ask  questions or respond to queries on Blackboard regarding projects

 or   other  assignments, <b>so long as you  do not provide specific solutions to the

  overall problem  or algorithm design (even in English)</b>.  Often, students

  believe that "simple" code is acceptable to place on Blackboard.  However,

  because there is a wide variation in what different students and instructors

  regard as "simple," we must be very strict about the ban against Blackboard

  code.  <b>Only</b> an instructor, GTA or UTA is permitted to place code

on  blackboard unless it is code that has already been provided to all students

  (either as part of the assignment specification itself or within the class

  textbook). </p>

                             

<p>(4)  <b>Discussing Blackboard postings outside of Blackboard</b>.  Please

       note that <u>Blackboard assistance must remain on Blackboard</u>.

 "Summarizing"       Blackboard statements or responses to another student

verbally regarding      an assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject

to the above ban on  discussing     assignment solutions.  While it may seem

harmless, Blackboard  was set up   so that all assistance could be overseen

by instructors/TAs/UTAs,  and it  is nearly impossible to truly duplicate

Blackboard discussion outside   of Blackboard, thus creating the potential

for either (unknown) mistaken  advice, or for unfair advantage by certain

students.  If you truly wish to  assist a fellow student, encourage him or

her to log onto Blackboard, and  direct him/her to specific postings you

find helpful.</p>
<p>(5)  <b>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</b>.  It
  
  is important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final
  
  submission.  If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit
  
  will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not changed
  
  after being submitted. </p>

                             

<p>(6)  <b>Code must run on Mason gcc</b>.  Students may develop 

      programs using any computer system they have available. Please note, 

 however,     that submitted projects must run under a C compiler available 

 either on   Mason.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong><br>
  GMU is an Honor Code university; please see the University Catalog for a full       description of the code and the honor committee process. The principle of academic       integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely. What does       academic integrity mean in this course? Essentially this: when you are responsible       for a task, you will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&rsquo;s work       in an aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the       proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free play       of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this course, with       the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be conducted with civility       and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt       (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.<br>
</p>
<p><strong> GMU EMAIL ACCOUNTS</strong><br>
  Students must activate their GMU email accounts to receive important University       information, including messages related to this class. You should understand       that your emailbox may be full, so check your email and make sure you have enough       space daily. <br>
