<h3>Class website</h3>

<p>
The class website is 
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~dnord/infs519">http://cs.gmu.edu/~dnord/infs519</a>/.  
Teaching assistants, programming assignments, etc. will be posted there.
</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>
The textbook is Michael Main, <i>Data Structures &amp; Other Objects Using JAVA</i>,
3<sup>rd</sup> ed., Addison-Wesley, 2006.
</p>

<h3>The course</h3>

<p>
The prerequisite for this course is SWE 510 or its equivalent.  I will assume
a "semester's worth" of programming experience in Java.  You should understand
basic programming in Java including program design, coding, and debugging
techniques.
</p>

<p>
Topics for the course include:
</p><blockquote><li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Generic classes</li>
<li>Binary trees</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Stacks and queues</li>
<li>Sorting</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>File organization</li>
<li>Graphs</li>
<li>Whatever else appeals</li>
</blockquote><p></p>

<h3>Programs</h3>

<p>
There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website</p>

<p>
You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>,
and the University honor code: 
<a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">http://honorcode.gmu.edu/
</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors 
Committee.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</p>

<p>
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "I accidentally deleted my program" are <i>not</i>
reasons for late submissions).
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</p>



<ul>
<li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</ul>
