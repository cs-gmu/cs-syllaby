<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students  
become                 effective professionals in the field of computer science
 by   examining          many    of the challenging legal and ethical issues
   surrounding   computer         technology    and its use, and building
a  foundation for   dealing with     those    challenges.    Students will
examine  the philosophical   bases for    ethical   decision-making    and
how to apply them to issues   raised by computers   and   technology. Specific
   topics covered in CS  105, such as intellectual   property   concerns,
will be addressed by this  course  in a more intensive   manner.   Emerging
legal and ethical issues  involved in the computer profession   and    e-commerce
   will also be addressed.  </p>
                                                                        
          
<p>Throughout the course, students will be expected to apply critical   thinking
                 skills in individual and group settings to evaluate   various
   issues       related      to computer law and ethics.  Students  will
connect    issues    of   technology    to  wider societal concerns through
  class   discussion,      a  mock    trial, and in-class activities.  Students
      will   use critical thinking skills to evaluate   and prepare  formal 
 arguments        concerning   their assigned mock trial   topics, which 
they will present     to   their classmates.    Students should  be prepared 
 to participate during     class   activities, to interact  with  their classmates, 
   and to reflect  upon   and refine  their personal  points   of view on 
various   ethical issues.  </p>

<p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a Writing Intensive   (WI)
                  Course that, together with CS 421, meets the GMU WI  Requirements
         for    the    BS CS Program. Accordingly, each student  in CS 306
 is  required      to   write  a  minimum of 1750 individual words,  which
 will  be graded  and    returned   to  the  student with feedback. This
requirement    will be  fulfilled    in part by preparing  an individual
analysis of case    law related to their Mock Trial legal elements, which
will be returned with   feedback.  Students will be permitted to be revise
and resubmit this assignment   after receiving feedback.  Students will also
  write at least two individual   short  essays reflecting on certain aspects
 of issues related to the class.    In addition,  students will work with
 partners to research    and write  materials in preparation  for their Mock
 Trials.<br>
