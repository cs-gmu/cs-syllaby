<b>Description</b> 
<dd>
<p>
This graduate course covers two hugely popular types of systems:
Web search engines and recommender systems. Web search engines attempt to
locate information items (e.g., documents, Web pages) based on user
specifications. These systems have developed from traditional systems for
bibliogrphic information retrieval dating back 50 years, and, with the
exception of Web browsers, arguably are the most widely-used tool for
accessing information on the Web. Recommeder systems discover information
items (e.g., people, products) that are likely to be of interest to
users. This coure will explore both types of systems, underlining their shared
principles. Roughly, two thirds of the course will be devoted to search
engines and one third to recommender systems.

<b>Prerequisites</b> 
<dd>
<p>
The four foundation courses of the INFS, SWE and ISA Master's programs:
<ol>
<li>
SWE 510: Object-oriented Programming
<li>
INFS 501: Discrete and Logical Structures
<li>
INFS 515: Computer Organization
<li>
INFS 519: Program Design and Data Structures
</ol>
Students from the CS Master's and PhD programs with full degree status (i.e.,
non-provisional) are waived from these prerequisites. Students from other
programs (including provisional or non-degree students) must provide evidence
of having taken courses equivalent to these foundation courses.<br>
Prerequisites are strictly enforced!
