    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Computer Science Illuminated</i></b> (6th Edition) by Nell Dale
        and John Lewis</li>
      <li><a href="http://sci.informatik.uni-kl.de/rechnerzugang/unix/unix_book.pdf"><i><b>Introduction
              to Unix</b></i></a> by Fiamingo, DeBula, Condron, available online
        for free.</li>
      <li>Assigned readings of webpages and other materials will be given as the
        course progresses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Computing Resources:</b> It is assumed that students will have access
      to a computer and have the ability to install software.&nbsp; Some
      university labs provide the needed software to complete assignments, but
      in order to gain experience, it is preferable to use a personal system. If
      a student anticipates difficulty accessing a suitable environment, contact
      your instructor.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <b>Course Description:</b> This course provides a baseline knowledge of
    technical and social issues at the heart of computer science. No prior
    knowledge of computing or programming is assumed. Students will develop a
    basic understanding of simple algorithms, information representation, and
    styles of problem solving which strongly affect computer science. They will
    gain practical experience working with a Unix-like operating system. Data
    security will be discussed to ensure safe communication. Students will gain
    exposure to basic software development tools such as version control, text
    editors, and shell scripting. A variety of social and ethical issues will be
    discussed throughout the course including information ownership and the
    impact of computing on society.
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
      <p>This course is required for all computer science students and serves as
        an opportunity for students to be introduced to Computer Science
        Department policies. Freshmen and transfer students are required to take
        the course in order to ensure that all CS students have exposure to
        certain essential tools and topics early on to enable their use in
        subsequent classes.</p>
    </div>
    <b>Prerequisite:</b> None. Enrollment in the course is limited to students
    in the BS Applied Computer Science or BS Computer Science programs. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note: </b>Students who have completed CS 310, CS 330, and CS 367 should
    <b>NOT</b> enroll in CS 110. Please see your academic advisor for
    alternative options regarding the completion of your BS CS or BS ACS course
    requirements.<br>

    <b>Learning Outcomes: </b>This course is intended to meet the IT Ethics
    component of the Mason Core Requirements. To do this, it will address the
    following outcomes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>IT Outcome #3: <b><i>Students will understand many of the key
            ethical, legal and social issues related to information technology
            and how to interpret and comply with ethical principles, laws,
            regulations, and institutional policies.</i></b>&nbsp; This will be
        met through class discussions related to ethical theories and social
        implications of current computing trends such as Artificial
        Intelligence, Software Reliability and Social Media. Several class
        assignments will also address these topics.</li>
      <li>IT Outcome #5: <i><b>Students will understand the essential issues
            related to information security, how to take precautions and use
            techniques and tools to defend against computer crimes.</b></i> This
        outcome will be met by class lectures on encryption, student use of
        secure communication channels (i.e. Virtual Private Networks), and an
        assignment on the modification of software security settings.</li>
    </ul>
    The course also has the following outcomes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li> <i><b>Students will understand the requirements of the Computer
            Science Major at GMU and have an appreciation of Computer Science as
            a discipline. </b></i>This will be met with lectures on the
        requirements for the CS major, as well as assignments that teach about
        the history of computer science and the people who influenced its
        progress. </li>
      <li><i><b>Students will have a basic understanding of the Unix operating
            system and how computers convey, store, and manipulate
            information.&nbsp;</b></i> This will be met through class lectures
        and assignments that assess the students' understanding of Unix, binary
        numerical operations, ASCII representation of text, and logical
        operations.</li>
      <li><i><b>Students will learn techniques for general problem solving and
            dividing complex problems into manageable component parts.</b></i>
        This will be met through class lectures that discuss various factors
        that hinder one's ability to find solutions to problems, puzzle solving
        techniques, and exercises that teach students how to break down the
        steps necessary to create solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <b>Late Assignments: </b>Assignments turned in after the due date will be
    penalized 10 percent per day (incl. weekend days/holidays). You should
    recognize that late work can cause major penalties, so start work early! If
    your assignment isn't the way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near,
    submit it anyway for partial credit. <b>In fact, submit early and often! </b>
    The Blackboard system permits you to retrieve and resubmit your assignment
    until the due date, so you may resubmit if you improve your assignment prior
    to the deadline. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resubmissions
      after the deadline require approval of your TA</span> (s/he may already
    have graded your assignment). If you know that you wish to resubmit a new
    version after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your TA no
    later than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time
    submission. <b>No resubmissions may be made after an assignment has been
      graded.</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Class Communications: &nbsp;</b>CS 110 will be using Piazza and
    Blackboard for most class communications. You are responsible for any
    notifications or information posted on Blackboard/Piazza either by your
    instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s), and you will need to check the
    systems regularly for such notices. Some information may be disseminated
    through these systems rather than in class. Individual communications with
    the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by email using your GMU email account.
    When you email, please be sure to include your name, the class number and
    the topic in the subject header. (E.g.: Subject: Jim Jones / CS 110-003 /
    Homework 2)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Accommodations:</span>&nbsp; If you
    are a student with a disability, please see your instructor and contact the
    Office of Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. All academic
    accommodations <b><span style="font-style: italic;">must</span></b> be
    arranged through the ODS: http://ods.gmu.edu<br>
    <br>
    <b>Absences and Participation Credit:</b>&nbsp; Any absences from class for
    health or emergency reasons are excusable only if reasonable notice is
    provided, in advance if possible.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Honor Code Policies:</span>&nbsp; All
    students are expected to abide by the GMU Honor Code found at <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/">http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/</a>.
    This policy is rigorously enforced. Unless otherwise specified, all
    class-related assignments are to be individual efforts. Certain portions of
    group assignments may require individual efforts as well.&nbsp; Be careful
    to follow instructions regarding acceptable group efforts.&nbsp; Plagiarism
    is governed by the GMU Honor Code and will not be tolerated.&nbsp; Cheating
    on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification of the
    Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. Sharing, collaboration,
    or looking at any assignments that are not your own is considered cheating.
    Review the university honor code and present any questions regarding the
    policies to instructor.<br>
    <br>
    The computer science department has an additional, more restrictive <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Honor Code</a> that you are also subject to. Make sure you read and
    familiarize yourself with these rules.<br>
