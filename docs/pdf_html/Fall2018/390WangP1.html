      <p><strong>Course Description:</strong>      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        CS 390 provides students with an introduction
        to the research and project design process as applied within the
        computing field.  Students will learn about the tools of the trade and
        work through design principles starting with the articulation of a
        question, reviewing methods
        of exploration, gathering evidence, communicating results,
        and assessing/evaluating research or project outcomes.
        
        <p>
        This course is for students who are interested in 
        getting involved in undergraduate research 
      <a href= "https://cs.gmu.edu/current-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/"> (see UROP) </a>
        or who plan to do a senior design project by taking CS 490 - Design Exhibition in the future.

        <p>
        Students will work individually and in small groups, and participate
        in a research or design experience.  See the 
        <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pwang/cs390/timetable.html">Lecture Timetable</a> 
        for the list of topics that will be covered in the class.

      <h4>Course Requirements &amp; Grading:      </h4>

      <blockquote>
        CS 390 is an activity-based course.  This means that students
        must attend all classes and contribute to on-going
        discussions.  There are no exams, but the course grade will be based
        on class participation and completion of a semester project or research paper:

        <blockquote> 
        (1) Participation: readings critiques, progress reports, and presentations: 40%
         <p>
        (2) Semester project: 60%
        <blockquote> 
                30% - project design/research plan documents, including regular progress reports and revisions<br><br>
                30% - final report containing documented software and/or project artifacts.  For a research paper, final document should show evidence of an original contribution 
        </blockquote> 
        </blockquote> 

      The tentative list of required activities can be found on the 
      <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pwang/cs390/timetable.html">Lecture Timetable</a> webpage.
