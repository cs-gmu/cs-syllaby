<b>

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>
<p><h3>Teaching Assistant</h3> Yajie Yang
<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2018/cs580/home">https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2018/cs580/home</a>
<p><h3>Textbook</h3>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Russell & Norvig,
             Prentice Hall
<p><h3>Supplementary texts</h3>
<ul>

  <p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>	A working knowledge of computer systems and several
		programming languages is required.  The material covered
		in CS 310 (or INFS 519) and CS 330 (or CS 530) as well as general computer science
		maturity is assumed and used throughout the course.
  
<p><h3> Content </h3>	The basic principles of representation, heuristic search,
                learning, and control will be presented in the context
                of specific AI areas such as problem solving, vision, 
		natural language, and expert systems.  The Python
                programming language will be used as the primary
                language for homework assignments. 

<p><h3>Exams </h3> There will be a midterm and final exam.

  <p><h3> Homework </h3>	There will be several programming assignments which will
		include written summaries. Other assignments could
		include practice problems from the textbook and/or old
		exams. 

  <p><h3> Grading</h3>	The course grade will be determined approximately as
		follows:
  <ul>
<li> homework:	40%
<li> midterm:	25%
<li>  final:	35%
    </ul>


<p><h3>Individual work</h3>
You are free to discuss ideas for both the labs and projects with other students, however <b>no joint work is permitted</b>. Any submitted work must be yours alone. Any work which shows too much similarity with others' submitted work will receive a grade of 0. Extreme or repeat cases may result in failing the course or referral to the Honor Commitee.
