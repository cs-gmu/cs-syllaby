		  <h2>Description</h2>
		  <p>Welcome to the graduate course on Distributed Systems
		  and Cloud Computing.  This course will introduce you to an
		  exciting range of materials in this broad and hugely
		  important field, including the fundamentals of distributed
		  systems, memory-driven computing, container clouds,
		  serverless computing, massive-scale cloud storage, big data
		  foundation, and a wide range of other important techniques
		  and case studies about this fascinating area of study.</p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		  <p>There is no specific prerequisite. But this course assumes 
		  familiarity with systems, including how operating systems work
		  (CS471), how networks work (CS455), and how compute hardware
		  functions (CS367 and CS465). If you don't have this background,
		  you should be in communication with me (the instructor) at the beginning
		  of the semester. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Who is this course for</h2>
		  <p>This course is primarily intended for graduate students (CS/ECE)
		  and motivated seniors who want to learn the latest research advances
		  in distributed systems and cloud computing areas, and are interested
		  in building distributed systems used/demanded by existing/emerging
		  data-intensive applications. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Teaching assistant (TA)</h2>
		  <p>TBD</p>

		  </br>

		  <h2>Materials</h2>
		  <p>No textbook required. The course is based on readings
		  (listed in the schedule of the course web page: 
		  <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs795_fall18/index.html">https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/teaching/cs795_fall18/index.html</a>) and
		  in-class discussions/presentations.</p>
		  </br>


		  <h2>Topics</h2>
		  <p>Tentative:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Distributed systems foundation</li>
			<li>Serverless computing</li>
			<li>Container clouds</li>
			<li>Memmory-driven computing</li>
			<li>Cloud storage</li>
			<li>Resource disaggregation</li>
			<li>Rack-scale computing</li>
			<li>Big data foundation</li>
			<li>Non-volatile memories and heterogeneous memory/storage</li>
		  </ul>
		  </br>
		  
		  <h2>Homework questions</h2>
		  <p>Every class day will focus on one or two or three papers, which you should 
		  read before class. To help encourage this excellent habit, we provide you with
		  a review form which you must complete and submit by 9am (or so) the day of class.</p>
		  </br>
		  
		  <h2>Paper presentations</h2>
		  <p>Each student will sign up and present two or three
		  papers, depending on the size of the class. The instructor
		  will give lectures on important concepts. Each paper presentation
		  should contain two parts: one in which you present the work
		  as if it were your own, and a second part in which you
		  present your evaluation of the work. 
		  </p>
		  </br>
		  
		  <h2>Assignments</h2>
		  <p>There will be a few programming assignments to get you
		  warmed up and going this semester.  They will be linked
		  from the main page and due about 1 or 2+ weeks from the day
		  they are assigned. In these assignments, you will learn
		  hands-on what it is to build distributed systems and cloud
		  computing applications, usually with one partner. <strong>The assignments will
          involve extensive use of real-world cloud platforms and resources. And therefore, each student
          is expected to receive a number of AWS cloud credits ($50-$200) for
          working on real-world cloud platforms. </strong>
          </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Projects</h2>
		  <p>The most important work outside of class will be the
		  final project.  This will form a large part of your grade,
		  and is also done with a parter or two.  Projects are the
		  beginning of your venture into the world of research, and
		  thus will be open-ended explorations of some kind. More
		  information on final projects will be given about 1.5
		  months from the beginning of the semester. The final 
		  projects consist of a few phases with milestones: i)
		  proposal and presentation, ii) implementation and
		  evaluation, iii) final presentation and/or demo, and iv)
		  final report and source code.</p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Grading policy</h2>
		  <p>Your grade will be calculated as follows: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>10% Homeworks questions</li>
			<li>20% Paper presentations and in-class discussions</li>
			<li>20% Assignments</li>
			<li>50% Final projects</li>
		  </ul>
		  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
			Note: No credit if your project does not compile. Late
			submissions of homeworks and programming assignments
			will be penalized at 15% each day, and will not be
			accepted after 3 days of the due date. The students are
			responsible for keeping back-ups of their work while
			they are working on an assignment. 
		  </div>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Academic integrity</h2>
		  <p>All students must adhere to the 
		  <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">
			GMU Honor Code</a>
		  and the 
		  <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">
			Computer Science
			Department's Honor Code
		  </a>
		  Policies. The students are supposed to work individually on
		  the homeworks, assignments projects, unless told otherwise.
		  We reserve the right to use 
		  <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">
			MOSS
		  </a>
		  to detect plagiarism. Violation of the Honor
		  Code will result in an F. </p>
		  </br>

		  <h2>Accommodations for disabilities</h2>
		  <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may
		  affect academic performance, you should: </p>
		  <ol>
			<li>make sure this documentation is
			  on file with Office for Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 4205; 993-2474;
			  <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">
				http://ods.gmu.edu</a>) to determine the accommodations you need;</li> 
			<li>talk
			  with the instructor within the first week of the semester
			  to discuss any accommodation needs.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </br>
