      <H3>Discussion Forum</H3>
      <P>There's a discussion forum on the GMU's Blackboard page of the course. You can ask questions/share information about the course there.</P>


      <H3>Description</H3>
      <p>This course will cover the fundamentals of computational design. Topics to discuss include 3D modeling, 3D representation, procedural modeling, simulation, and computational interaction. Students will also learn about evaluating designs by user studies and hypothesis testing. Advanced topics on using optimization and artificial intelligence techniques for generating designs will also be discussed.</p>
     	
      <H3>Prerequisites</H3>
      <UL>
        <LI>Geometry and Algebra
        <LI>Programming Languages and Algorithms
        <LI>Engineering Mechanics
        <LI>(No prior knowledge of graphics is assumed.) </LI></UL></A>

The prerequisites stated above are not strict requirements. Students may learn the above topics by self-study.
Students are welcome to talk to the instructor if they are uncertain whether their background is good enough for taking the course.

<H3>Textbooks</H3>

<p>Students should be able to understand the course content just by following the lecture notes. However, the following textbooks serve as good references.</p>

<H3>Extra Credits (Masons)</H3>
      <P>You are highly encouraged to implement the extra credits in each project. Extra credits will be converted to points using a scale to be determined (e.g. 1 extra credit will be converted to 0.5 point). An actual implementation of an extra credit item may be worth somewhat more or less than its nominal value, depending on how well it was implemented. </P>

<P>
Note:
<DL>
<DT>1) You need to <B>describe</B> the extra credits you have implemented in your <B>readme</B> file.</DT>
<DT>2) <B>No extra credit</B> will be awarded for any <B>late</B> submission.</DT>
<DT>3) <B>No extra credit</B> will be earned until <B>ALL</B> of the required parts of the project are complete.</DT>
</DL>

You may still get the maximum score in this course (i.e. 100 pts, an A+) even if you don't try any extra credit. But it is absolutely worth trying some of them, to make up some points you missed just in case, and also for fun.

</P>
      <H3>Projects</H3>
      There will be mandatory projects to be completed independently. 

Please check the due dates of the projects in the project webpages.

Beyond required extensions to the base project, you are strongly encouraged attempt the extra credits, which translate into (a certain number of) points.&nbsp;


<P>The grader reserves the right to question any part of your submission, even it looks correct. You are supposed to have clear knowledge of what you implemented. <B>If you do not understand what you have implemented, points will not be counted.</B> </P>

<P>
If you discuss your projects with others, you should submit their names along with the assignment material. Reverse engineering the sample executable and using code from previous offerings of the course or from any other source constitute plagiarism and are strictly prohibited. We will use automated tools to check for plagiarism.
</P>


      <H3>Submission and Makeup Policy</H3>
      <P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px">	
(1) Unless a solid reason and <B>its supporting evidence are given</B>, e.g., due to illness, emergency, NO makeup is acceptable for students missing an exam; <br><br>

(2) Homeworks and projects are due <b>at 11:59pm</b> on the due date. They may be submitted late by no more than 24 hours, weekend and holiday counted. <b>The penalty for late submission within 24 hours is 20% of the score. If the submission is late for more than 24 hours, zero score will be given.</b><br><br>

(3) That said, you are given <b>a one-day chance</b> for late project submission without penalty, to accomodate for important events such as participating in a sports competition (needs supporting evidence). However, <b>this is the only chance</b>. You must email the instructor with supporting reasons when you want to use this chance to compensate for a late submission, so that your score will be counted accordingly. After this chance is used up, there is no more.<br><br>

(4) We will use the Blackboard system to collect your homework files. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL the TA or the INSTRUCTOR your homework files; we cannot keep track of that because there are many students.<br>

<P><I>Note again: No extra credit will be awarded for any late submission (even you used your one-day chance to compensate for the lateness).</I></P>




<h3>Honor Code:</h3>
GMU is an Honor Code university; please see the
<a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">Office for Academic 
Integrity</a> for a full description of the code and the honor committee 
process, and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">Computer 
Science Department's Honor Code Policies</a> regarding programming assignments. 
The principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations are 
treated gravely.

<p>What does academic integrity mean in this course? Essentially 
this: when you are responsible for a task, you will perform that task. When you 
rely on someone else's work in an aspect of the performance of that task, you 
will give full credit in the proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic 
integrity is the free play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are 
encouraged in this course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the 
class will be conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, 
perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for 
guidance and clarification.</p>


      <P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px">
<font color="red">[Important]</font> Also note that posting projects
or solutions on public websites <b>requesting or offering to pay for
outside assistance is strictly prohibited </b>. It is also not allowed to
publicly post your solutions, even this is for free, as it allows
other students to copy them and hence results in plagiarism. These are
all serious academic dishonesty. Students (whether past or current
students) involved in these activities will be identified and
sanctioned.
      </P>


<h3>Accommodations for Disabilities:</h3>
If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may affect 
academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with
<a href="http://ds.gmu.edu/">Disability Services</a> (SUB I Suite 2500; 
703-993-2474; <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu/">http://ds.gmu.edu</a>) to determine 
the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation 
needs.
