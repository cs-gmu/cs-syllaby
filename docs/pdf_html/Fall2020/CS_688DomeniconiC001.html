     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>General Description and Preliminary List of Topics</b></FONT SIZE=+1> <br>
        
Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do things. For
example, we might be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions,
or to navigate in an unexplored environment. The learning that is being done is always based on some sort
of observations or data, such as examples (the most common case in this course), direct
experience, or instruction. So in general, machine learning is about learning to do better in
the future based on what was experienced in the past.
The emphasis of machine learning is on automatic methods. In other words, the goal is
to devise learning algorithms that do the learning automatically without human intervention
or assistance. 
<br><br>
The machine learning paradigm can be viewed as “programming by example.”
Often we have a specific task in mind, such as recognizing handwritten digits on an envelope to perform automated mail dispatching. But rather than program the computer with rules to solve the task directly, in machine learning, we seek methods by which the computer will come up with its own program based on examples that we provide.
<br><br>
The course covers key algorithms and theory at the core of machine learning.
Particular emphasis will be given to the statistical learning aspects of the field.
Topics include:
decision theory, Bayesian theory, curse of dimensionality, linear and non-linear 
dimensionality reduction techniques, classification, clustering, neural networks, 
kernel methods, mixture models and EM, ensemble methods, deep learning (if time permits).

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Format</b></FONT SIZE=+1> <br> 
     Lectures by the instructor. Besides material from the textbook, topics not discussed in the book may also be
     covered.
     Research papers and handouts of material not covered in the book will
     be made available. 
     Grading will be based on quizzes, 
    an exam, and a project. Homework assignments will be given and discussed in class, but not graded. In order to learn the material and to do well on quizzes and  the exam, students are required to work on the assignments.
     Graded work must be done on an individual basis, unless otherwise stated by the instructor. Any deviation from this policy will be considered a violation of the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/">
            GMU Honor Code</a>. <br><br>

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Project</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br>
The project gives students an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic/area of the course. The topic of the project, of course, should be related to the material covered in class, but otherwise students are free to select the specific topic. Possible types of projects include:
   <blockquote>
     <li>
     <b>An application research project</b>: The project demonstrates the application of some techniques discussed in class in an application domain (e.g., text mining, bioinformatics, computer vision, image processing,  artificial intelligence etc.). Properties, drawbacks, advantages of the used techniques are analyzed within the context of the explored application domain.     
     </li>
 
     <li>
     <b>A theoretical or methodological research project</b>: A study of different classes of models and approaches; proving either theoretically or experimentally properties of known algorithms; designing a new approach. 
     </li>
