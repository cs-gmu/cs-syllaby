<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
This course is intended to help students learn to think in the manner
necessary to fully grasp the nature and power of the digital world
around us.  The early era of the Internet and the personal computer
led to the need for "computer literacy."  Now, the changing nature of
our global society requires that students learn new ways to think
about problems and how to solve them, regardless of students' specific
fields of endeavor.  Through this course, students will explore major
issues related to the "big ideas" of computational thinking (namely,
(i) Creativity, (ii) Abstraction, (iii) Data, (iv) Algorithms, (v)
Programming, (vi) Internet, and (vii) Societal Impact), as well as how
these issues will impact their future lives.
</p>

<p>
Topics to be covered include.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Representation of ideas with bits
</li>
<li>Basic boolean logic
</li>
<li>Devices to implement logic functions
</li>
<li>Programming Languages for data and action
</li>
<li>Primitive Operations and Abstraction 
</li>
<li>Algorithms for work and play
</li>
<li>Communication between machines
</li>
<li>Computing Security Concepts
</li>
<li>Basic data analysis
</li>
<li>Impact of automation and communication on human societies
</li>
<li>Human and Machine Intelligence

<p>
By the end of the semester, a passing student will be able to carry
out the following types of activities:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Students will be able to use technology to locate, access,
evaluate, and use information, and appropriately cite resources
from digital/electronic media.
</li>
<li>Students will understand the core IT concepts in a range of current
and emerging technologies and learn to apply appropriate
technologies to a range of tasks.
</li>
<li>Students will understand many of the key ethical, legal and social
issues related to information technology and how to interpret and
comply with ethical principles, laws, regulations, and
institutional policies.
</li>
<li>Students will understand the essential issues related to
information security, how to take precautions and use techniques
and tools to defend against computer crimes.
</li>

During lectures we will discuss computing concepts and instructors
will provide demos of programming relevant to assignments.
Occassionally some work will be done in class which students submit
and will contribute to the student's overall grade in the class.  The
days in which in-class work will be done will not be announced in

<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Homework Assignments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Homework will be a mixture of problem solving, writing English
responses to questions, and writing code.  Some HW will be individual
effort and other HW may be done in groups of a limited size.  All HW
must be submitted in electronic form to Blackboard by posted
deadlines.  The exact nature of what should be submitted will be
described in each HW.  Some HW assignments will be relatively short
and have a short turn-around time for submission (1 week) while other
assignments will be longer with a turn-around reflecting the effort
(2-3 weeks).
</p>

<p>
Homework will be submitted electronically on Blackboard. Students may
submit paper copies to get additional feedback from the grader.

<p>
Students will select a computing topic in the middle of the course on
which to do research and craft a substantial paper on the subject.
This will require library and online research and will include both a
technical component and a social component.  The term paper will be due
on the last day of class and will be submitted electronically.

<h3 id="sec-3-6"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> Bonus Credit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
Bonus credit will be awarded based on participation in class
discussions.  Students may elect to sit in the first few rows of the
room ("hot seats") and answer questions.  Reasonable effort on
answering questions in class will garner class participation credit.
Participation points may also earned for involvement in the class
discussion board such as giving suggestions to students with questions
(but not revealing answers wholesale).  The highest point winner at
the end of the semester will receive a 3% bonus to their overall score
in the course.  All other students will receive a bonus proportional
to the highest point winner.  For example, someone tied with the
highest point scorer will also receive a 3% bonus while someone with
half the participation points will receive a 1.5% bonus.

<p>
Address grading issues with the grader first which is either the UTA
or GTA and will be included as part of grading feedback. Disputes
should be made respectfully either in person or via e-mail.  If it is
not possible to reach a resolution, the professor may be contacted by
the grader or student to resolve the dispute.

<li>Homework is due via electronic submission by the beginning of class
on the specified due dates (usually Thursday class).  You can submit
work to BlackBoard as many times as desired.  Only the last
submission will be graded.
</li>
<li>Work will <b>not be accepted</b> more than 4 days after the assigned
deadline.
</li>
<li>Late work will be accepted with a -10% penalty per day late.

<p>
<b>Example:</b> HW is due on 10/10 and Jafar hands in his assignment on
10/12. Jafar would have scored 83 but instead gets <code>83 - 10*2 =
  63</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Iago wants to hand in his assigment on 10/15 but it will not be
accepted as it is too late (&gt; 4 days late).
</p>
</li>
<li>On-time submissions will generally be graded and available a week
from submission, though exceptional circumstances may cause delays.
Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as schedules
allow.

<h3 id="sec-5-4"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Fair Collaboration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talking to other students in the course about HW problems and
informally describing how a problem may be solved.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be <b>very careful</b> as you do this that you do not share any sort of
code as this will be detected.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting or giving help fixing a small bug or two: a second set
of eyes is a great boon to finding that misplaced semicolon that is
preventing your code from compiling.
</li>
<li>Searching the Internet for alternative presentations of a
programming concept.  
</li>
<li>When unsure whether collaboration is fair or not, stop the activity
until it can be cleared with instructor.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#PRIME-DIRECTIVE">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with
another student.  The above collaborations should be limited to
getting someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish
line.
</p>

<p>
About half your grade will depend on programming projects.  Doing them
individually prepares you for the exams in which no collaboration of
any kind is allowed.

<p>
Since this is a programming course, some special policies will be in
effect.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming assignments will be submitted to Blackboard at the
specified dates.  You may submit assignments to Blackboard as many
times as you like: only the most recent submission will be graded
(up to the deadline). 
</li>
<li>Back up your program regularly.  Keeping backup copies of your work
is your responsibility.  Losing work due to a disk failure,
accidental deletion, etc., is not a justification for late
submission.  Technologies like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> automate the task of backing
up which can make life much easier and safer.  Submitting occasional
early versions to Blackboard is also wise.  Should last-minute
problems happen such as accidental deletion, you will at least have
some of your work to show.  No code to submit means no credit.
</li>
<li>Submitted code that does not compile or run error-free will receive
little to no credit.
</li>
<li>When test cases are provided by the instructor use them and make
sure your code passes all tests.
</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how plagiarism works with programming as
described in other parts of the syllabus.
</li>
<li>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission. It is
important that you not touch your programs once you have made your
final submission. If there are any submission problems,
consideration for credit will only be given if it can be verified
that the programs were not changed after being submitted.

<p>
Students are expected to maintain a high level of civility for all

the beliefs of participants of all genders, ethnicities, and social
backgrounds.  Harassment of any type will not be tolerated and failure
to behave in a respectful manner will result in referrals to
University Counseling or the Office of Student Judicial Affairs.  Any
instances of sexual harassment will be reported to the Office of Equal

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Guidelines for Success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most homework problems have analogs that are (1) discussed in
lecture or (2) described in an example problem in the textbook.
This should encourage you to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attend lecture and take notes
</li>
<li>Read the content of each section of the textbook carefully
</li>
<li>Analyze the example code distributed by the instructor
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most successful students do all of these.
</p>
</li>
<li>Seek help from the instructor or teaching assistant when a
concept is unclear.  If you blow a problem on a HW or exam and don't
see why, attend office hours to ask about it.  We are here to aid
your learning process.
</li>
<li>Form good habits early on.  We have a large amount of material to
cover which means you will need to spend time outside of lecture
reading and experimenting. Things will move <b>fast</b> so don't fall
behind.
</li>
<li>There is a wealth of information on data structures online.  Don't
be afraid to consult online tutorials if a particular topic is
troublesome for you.  However, <b>do not</b> misuse to the Internet to
obtain solutions that you don't understand.  Follow the <a href="#PRIME-DIRECTIVE">PRIME
DIRECTIVE</a> at all times.
