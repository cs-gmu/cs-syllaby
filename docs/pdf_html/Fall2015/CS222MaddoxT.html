<p><b>DESCRIPTION:    </b>CS 222 is a second course in computer programming,
       emphasizing programming concepts relevant to engineers. Topics include
    lower   level language aspects and elementary data structures.  Students
   are expected   to have a basic understanding of the elements of programming
   in some high-level   language.  CS 222 will be taught using C, but students
   are not presumed to  be familiar with C prior to this class.   This course
   is intended as a terminal  course in programming for engineers.</p>
                           
<p><i>Prerequisite:  C or better in CS 112.</i> </p>

<p><i>Class:</i>  Class lectures will be held on Mon/Wed, from 9-10:15 a.m.&nbsp;each day.  Students are expected to attend all lectures
 each    week  and are responsible for all material covered during lecture.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Electronic Devices:<span style="font-style: italic;"> &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>Use
of electronic devices (including laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.)
is not permitted during class. &nbsp;Please make sure all such devices
are turned off or silenced while class is in session.
   </p>
                             
<p><i>Programming Assignments:</i> Programming assignments will be
posted on Blackboard as they are assigned, and must be submitted on
Blackboard by the assigned due date. &nbsp;Rubrics will typically be
provided for major assignments and should be consulted to be sure
specifications are met. &nbsp;If your program is incomplete, you may
still submit it for partial credit. However, <b>your code must run without 
obvious   errors  (even if not all functionality is present)</b>.  Building 
your programs     in  a modular fashion and debugging as you go are crucial 
concepts in program     development.  Additionally, your TA relies on running 
your program as part    of your grade determination.&nbsp;  <b>Accordingly, any 
programming assignment    that is submitted but either does not compile or 
has major errors when it   is run will receive no more than 50% credit.</b> 
</p>
                              
<p>Students are expected to work independently outside of class to familiarize 
      themselves with the GMU computer systems, to read and review all assigned 
      materials and to complete all homework and programming projects.   
</p>
                             
<p><i>Reading</i>: Students are responsible for reading and
understanding all assigned material. Be aware that some material
covered in class may not be found in your textbook. &nbsp;If you do not
understand any of the covered materal or reading assignments, there
will be opportunities to ask questions in class, on Blackboard or
during
UTA/GTA/instructor office hours. </p>
                             
<p><i>Due Dates</i>: Due dates for all programming projects will be
posted on Blackboard. Programming assignments are posted in advance,
and
are due in the manner stated in the specs (usually electronic
submission
through Blackboard) no later than the date specified. &nbsp;Homework
assignments are due in the manner stated (either through Blackboard or
in class.) </p>
                             
<p><i>Late work</i>: &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">No late submissions</span> are permitted for homework assignments. &nbsp;Late submissions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> permitted for programming projects,&nbsp;but will be penalized 10% per day (incl. weekend
       days/holidays).  You should recognize that this can cause major penalties
       for incomplete programs, so start work early!  If your program isn't
  the    way you'd like it to be when the deadline is near, submit it anyway
  for  partial   credit.  <b>In fact, submit early and often! </b> The system
  permits  you to&nbsp;resubmit your assignment until the due date,
  so you may  resubmit if you improve your program prior to the deadline.
 (Resubmissions  after the deadline require approval of your TA, since s/he
 may already have  graded your project.  If you know that you wish to resubmit
 a new version  after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your
 TA no later than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time
 submission.)   No resubmissions may be made after a project has been graded.
 </p>
                                      
<hr><b>GRADING POLICY</b>                             
<p>Your course grade will be a weighted average of the following items: </p>
                              
<ul>
               <tt><li>programming projects             (30% total)</li>
                </tt>  <tt><li>homework(20% total)</li><li>quizzes/instructor evaluation (5%)</li>
                </tt>  <tt><li>midterm exam(s) (20%)&nbsp;</li>
                </tt>  <tt><li>final examination                (25%)</li>
                </tt>               
</ul>
                              
<p>Individual programming projects may be
weighted differently from one another, at the instructor's    discretion.
 </p>
                             
<p>Instructor's evaluation may include in-class exercises.
&nbsp;Homework may include short programming assignments
and/or&nbsp;traditional homework exercises. &nbsp; </p>
                             

                                      
<hr><b>CLASS COMMUNICATIONS</b>                             
<p>CS 222 will be using the Blackboard system and GMU email for most
class communications. We may also be using Piazza for questions on
assignments. &nbsp;You are responsible for any announcements or
information posted on Blackboard or Piazza, either by your instructor,
your GTA or the class UTA(s). &nbsp;Since most Blackboard announcements
will also be sent to your gmu email account, please make sure your GMU
email account is active and able to receive messages.&nbsp; Individual
communications with the professor/GTA/UTA should also use&nbsp;your GMU
email account. When you email, please be sure to include your name, the
class number and section and the topic in the subject header. (E.g.:
Subject: Jim Jones / CS 222-001 / Project 2) </p>
                                         
<hr>                     <b>OFFICE OF DISABILITY SERVICES<br><br></b>If
you are a student with a disability, please contact the Office of
Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. &nbsp;I will be happy to
arrange any appropriate academic accomodations, but they must be
arranged through ODS (http://ods.gmu.edu).<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><b>PROGRAMMING POLICIES</b> 
              
<p>(1)  <b>No sharing or discussion of code for assignments</b>.&nbsp;Unless specifically stated
       otherwise, all assignments are individual projects, not group projects.
     Students  are expected to do their own work, not to share programs with
   each  other,  nor copy programs from anyone else.  This means you may
not    discuss  program  design or strategize solutions with anyone except
your   instructor  or a course  UTA or GTA.<b>  </b>&nbsp;However,
you may offer
more limited assistance to your fellow students regarding specific
questions on their programming assignments by responding to queries on
Blackboard or Piazza (see guidelines below). &nbsp;You may also discuss
general course concepts, including coding, so long as it is&nbsp;
outside of any assignment context. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any discussion or sharing of code outside these guidelines constitutes  an honor code violation</span>.  Suspected
 honor code violations are  taken very seriously, and will be reported to
the Honor Committee. (See <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/StatementOnAcademicIntegrity">CS  Department Integrity Statement</a> and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">Honor Code</a>)
</p>
                             
<p>(2)  <b>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</b><i>.</i> 
       You may <u>not</u>
incorporate code written by others, such as can be found on the
Internet or any of the numerous CS books available. You are encouraged
to use external sources to enhance your understanding of general
concepts, but you should not be using these sources to locate code to
include in any assigned programs. &nbsp;Of course, you
may freely use any code provided as part of the project specifications,
and you need not credit the source. &nbsp;However, if you use code
provided by your instructor/GTA/UTA (other than that given as part of
the project
specifications) or from the course textbook, you must document what
portion came from those sources. &nbsp;Working something out together
with an instructor or TA usually will not require crediting the source,
but when in doubt, sinply ask to make sure.&nbsp; </p>
                             
<p>(3)  <b>Blackboard/Piazza</b>.  We encourage the use of Blackboard or Piazza to discuss
       assignments and assist one another with programming questions.  You
 may    ask  questions or respond to queries regarding projects
 or   other  assignments, <b>so long as you do not post any C code or detailed
   pseudocode,  and so long as you do not provide specific solutions to the
  overall problem  or algorithm design (even in English)</b>.  Often, students
  believe that posting "simple" code is acceptable.  However,
  because there is a wide variation in what different students and instructors
  regard as "simple," we must be very strict about the ban against Blackboard
  code.  <b>Only</b> an instructor, GTA or UTA is permitted to place code
on  blackboard/piazza unless it is code that has already been provided to all students
  (either as part of the assignment specification itself or within the class
  textbook). </p>
                             
<p>(4)  <b>Discussing Blackboard/Piazza postings outside of Blackboard/Piazza.</b> &nbsp;Students must not discuss postings from Blackboard/Piazza outside of the electronic system. &nbsp;"Summarizing"
Blackboard statements or responses to another student
verbally regarding an assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject
to the above ban on discussing assignment solutions. While it may seem
harmless, Blackboard and Piazza were set up so that all assistance
could be overseen
by instructors/TAs/UTAs, and it is nearly impossible to truly duplicate
this type of discussion outside of the system itself, thus creating the
potential
for either (unknown) mistaken advice, or for unfair advantage by
certain
students. If you truly wish to assist a fellow student, encourage him
or
her to log onto Blackboard/Piazza, and direct him/her to specific
postings you
find helpful. </p>
                              
<p>(5)  <b>Back up your program regularly.</b>  You are expected to backup 
      your program in separate files as you get different pieces working. 
Failure      to do this may result in your getting a much lower grade on a
program  if   last minute problems occur.  (Accidently deleting your program, 
having  problems    connecting, etc., will <u>not</u> be accepted as excuses.) 
</p>
                             
<p>(6)  <b>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</b>.  It
is important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final
submission.  If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit
will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not changed
after being submitted. </p>
                             
<p>(7)  <b>Code must run on mason gcc</b>. Students are strongly
encouraged to develop programs directly on mason, and must test them
before submission to be sure they work properly under mason gcc.
&nbsp;Students who choose to disregard this advice and develop their
programs on other systems should not be surprised&nbsp;if their
programs fail to work on mason. &nbsp;Also, please note that the
instructor or TAs may not be able to answer questions regarding errors
encountered on other systems. &nbsp;Once makefiles are introduced, a
makefile should also be included with each assignment submission.
&nbsp;No credit will be given for unworking programs claimed to work
elsewhere, and no extensions will be given due to compiler incompatibilities.</p><hr><b><br>TENTATIVE CLASS SCHEDULE</b>
