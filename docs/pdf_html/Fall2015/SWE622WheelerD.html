<h1>Syllabus for SWE 622 - Distributed Software Engineering - Fall 2015</h1>

<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
This course conveys key 
concepts for designing and building distributed software systems.&nbsp; 
The course is geared towards software engineers that work mostly at the 
application-level, but need to understand the features and limitations 
of existing middleware for distributed systems.&nbsp; Additionally, the 
course covers some research topics related to currently open 
problems.&nbsp;Specifically, some of the topic that will be covered are 
as follows: definition and scope of distribution, principles of 
communication and computation, socket programming, remote method 
invocation, software architecture of distributed systems, middleware 
systems, service discovery, quality of service, adaptive systems, 
mobility, security, and fault tolerance.

<p>
The syllabus, including the schedule and topics to be covered,
is subject to change, but I will notify you of any changes.
This class is based on the structure set up by Dr. Sam Malek;
you'll see his name or URLs pointing to his site occasionally.

<p>
<a name="Reading List"></a>
<h1>Reading List</h1>
<p>
The textbook is
<i>Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms (2nd edition)</i>, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Maarten Van Steen, 2007, ISBN 0-13-239227-5.
See below for supplemental papers.

<p>
I may add a few additional required reading articles as we go.

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Five Reading Assignments  20% (5 x 4%)
<li>Two Programming Assignments 30% (2 x 15%)
<li>Two Exams 50% (2 x 25%)
</ol>
<p>
I grade on results, not effort.


<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>

<p>
The lectures will cover the key issues and
explain some things that might not be clear otherwise.
However, you are responsible for reading and understanding the material
in the assigned readings (and not just knowing what&#8217;s in the lectures).

<p>
First actual class date is September 2, 2015;
the last normal class day is December 9.
The last scheduled class day, December 16,
has a slightly different time (7:30 pm - 10:15 pm)
and might not be used for lecture
(this is the time assigned for final examinations).
We do not meet on November 25 due to Thanksgiving recess.
See the
<a href="http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/">GMU calendar</a>
for general information on the GMU calendar.
I routinely check the list of
<a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/calendar/religious-holiday-calendar/">&#8221;non-work&#8221;
religious holidays</a> maintained by GMU.

<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and <i>don&#8217;t distract others</i>.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate (and not make noise) in class.
<p>
Please talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with the mid-term, your topic presentation, or final presentation,
e.g., a <a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.
I can easily reschedule topic presentations; the others are much harder.
Don&#8217;t bother telling me if you&#8217;ll miss other class times;
I strongly recommend class attendance, but I understand if
work, family, or other commitments sometimes make that difficult to do.
You can always turn in work early
(e.g., if the deadline conflicts with a religious holiday).

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
GMU is an <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>
university; please see the University Catalog for
a full description of the code and the honor committee process. The
principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations
are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this
course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&#8217;s work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance
and clarification.
<b>Do not plagiarize.</b>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.
<p>
Although students are encouraged to discuss the topics covered
in class, all homework assignments, exams, and projects are to be
completed individually, unless joint work is explicitly authorized by
the instructor. If joint work is authorized, all contributing students
must be listed on the submission. Presenting as one's own the words, the
work, or the opinions of someone else without proper acknowledgment is
plagiarism. Any deviation from the aforementioned policies is considered
to be a violation of GMU’s Honor Code. Honor code violations can
result in the failure of the submission, failure of the class, or other
penalties.


<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Please use the instructor&#8217;s email address for class questions.
You <i>must</i> use your Mason email account for all email correspondence
having anything to do with your work at Mason. Federal laws protecting
your privacy rights require that we only communicate student information
directly to students - and use of the university email system is our
only way to validate your identity on email. You may forward your campus
email elsewhere, but we can respond only to a Mason email account.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
it&#8217;s nice to let me know as a courtesy, but you must
contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 703-993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations <i>must</i> be arranged through the ODS,
not through me.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me), please bring that <i>form</i> to me.
