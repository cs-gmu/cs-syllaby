<br><br>Overview: this course provides a survey of three important
networking technologies in significantly more detail than introductory
courses but in less detail than a full course would give each one.
<br><br>Prerequisites: bachelor's degree and working experience in any
branch of engineering, mathematics, or physical science discipline,
plus introductory level knowledge of networks from undergraduate or
graduate course or work experience. Students are expected to have a
working knowledge of engineering mathematics including
statistics/probability. Students who have not been admitted to a GMU
graduate program may enroll in non-degree status using a form at
<a href="http://admissions.gmu.edu/grad/apps/ITE_ND.pdf">
http://admissions.gmu.edu/grad/apps/ITE_ND.pdf</a>.
<br><br>Delivery: This course is taught simultaneously in the
classroom and live over the Internet to students at home or office.
Software to receive the class is generated under the GMU Network
EducationWare (NEW) project and is available for free download. Network
students receive the instructor's voice, slides, and drawing on the
whiteboard; students with higher-performance Internet connections also
can receive video. The voice and graphics are recorded and can be
played back from a server after class. To use the system, you must
download the software and test your reception *well before* the first
class. See webpage <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/disted">
http://netlab.gmu.edu/disted</a> for information and to
connect. Use your GMU email username and password.
Class sessions will be available synchronously at the time of
presentation (generally, 7:20 to 10:00 PM on Mondays) or asynchronously
from a recording of the scheduled session, played back via the NEW
software. <br><br><b>GRADING POLICY</b>

<br>Grades are proficiency-based. Cutoffs will be in the vicinity of
(and no higher than) A-:90% B-:80% C:70%.


<br><br><b>TEXTS</b>

<br>1. Smith, The Craft of System Security, Pearson, 2008

<br>2. Mauro and Schmidt, Essential SNMP 2nd Ed, O'Reilly, 2006

<br><br><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>

<br>Course notices will be provided via email. Students will be
provided with a password for conenction and download of slides
Students are responsible to read GMU email regularly.
Homework assignments will be posted to and submitted through Moodle
at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle">http://netlab.gmu.edu/moodle</a>.
Use your GMU email username and password.
Slide files will be available on the NEW site 24 hours before they
are presented in class. Students are responsible for all material
presented in class as outlined in the lecture slides. <br><br>

Homework for a given class will be posted by lecture time
and will be due by lecture time the next week. Late submissions lose
20% per week. After initial submission, you can repeat the homework up
to the exam or project submission for that block, and receive the
highest score of your submissions (less any points for late initial
submission.)
<br><br>Exams: SEC and MOB blocks will have exams outside of class
hours on a flexible schedule, in keeping with the delivery medium. MGT
has a project rather than an exam. The project involves use of free
network management software. It requires about 10 hours and is graded
based on two presentations (5-minte and a 15-minute) made in class
or over the Internet via NEW.
