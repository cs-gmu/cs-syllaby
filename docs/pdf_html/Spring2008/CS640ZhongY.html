Overview</b><br>  
This course will cover advanced techniques of language processing.&nbsp; Emphasis will be on 
analysis and optimizations in construction of compilers 
for high performances. There 
are several programming assignments associated with this 
course.&nbsp; Tentative topics include:<ul>
	<li>Data-flow and control-flow analysis</li>
	<li>Global optimization (inter- and intra-procedural)</li>
	<li>Code generation</li>
	<li>Generation and optimization for parallel, OO and functional programming 
	environments </li>
</ul>

<b>Prerequisites: CS540 and CS583 or 
equivalent.</b><br>
Students are expected to be familiar with 
compilation process and standard skills in constructing compiler front-ends.&nbsp;
In order to be able to work on the programming projects, students <i><b>must</b>
</i>be comfortable with Java programming language. You are encouraged to 
contact the instructor if you have concerns about the working language.

<p><b>Grading Policies</b><br>
  Tentative plans call for 3 to 4 programming/written assignments. These are to be individual efforts.&nbsp; Missed exams 
must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the 
illness (doctor's note) is required.&nbsp; No early exams will be given and 
make-up exams are strongly discouraged.&nbsp; Tentative grade 
distribution is: assignments: 45%, midterm: 20%, final: 30%, participation and 
quizzes: 5%.&nbsp; A total score of 49 or less will result in F.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy</b><br>
<b>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION FOR ILLNESS</b>, with the following exception: 
every student of the course is allowed to have a total of <b>3 FREE LATE DAYS</b>.&nbsp; Consider them as non-transferable, non-replaceable credits and use them wisely.&nbsp; If you wish to use one or more of these, indicate it clearly in your submission.&nbsp; No partial late day is in effect. You need one whole late day to cover a one-hour 
late submission.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be graded if you have used all three 
late days.&nbsp; <b>Partial credits</b> are available as long as you document well which 
parts have been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>Extra Credit</b><br>
There may be opportunities for extra credit on some of the projects 
or exams.&nbsp; To receive any extra credit for a project, all base functionality 
of a project must be implemented; extra credit portions of a project can not count 
in place of required features.&nbsp; Extra extensions other than your late days 
will not be given for completion of extra credit.<p> <b> <font color="#D50000">Honor Code</font></b><br>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Collaborations on any programming assignment 
	is unacceptable.&nbsp; Please refer to <A HREF="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">
GMU 
  Academic Policies</A> and  <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
Computer 
  Science Department Honor Code</a>.
Any violation of the honor code will result in a zero of the 
	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class. 
  <P> <font color="#0000FF">I will be using </font>
	<b><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">MOSS</a></b><font color="#0000FF"> to 
	detect plagiarism in programming assignments. </font>
