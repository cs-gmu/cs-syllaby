<h4><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+0">Overview</font></font></h4>

Wireless networks have become ubiquitous. The number of wireless
devices (phones,&nbsp;PDAs, laptops) already exceeds the number of
desktop computers, and this number is likely to increase exponentially
in the coming years as wireless sensors and RFID devices become
even more commonplace. <br>

<br>

Securing wireless networks is an extremely challenging and interesting
area of research. &nbsp;
Unprotected wireless networks are vulnerable to several security
attacks including eavesdropping and jamming that have no counterpart in
wired networks. Moreover, many wireless devices are resource limited,
which makes it challenging to implement security protocols and
mechanisms.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;The objective of this course is to enable
students to understand the main challenges in designing
security mechanisms and protocols for thwarting attacks on
existing and emerging wireless networks including wireless LANs, sensor
networks, &nbsp;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), vehicular, mesh,
and RFID networks. <br>

<br>

<p>The topics that will be discussed are:<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li>Introduction &amp; Background</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduction to Wireless Networks</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduction to Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Introduction to Security Issues for Wireless Networks</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Securing existing wireless networks</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>Challenges in securing next-generation wireless networks</li>

    <li>Trust Assumptions &amp; Adversary Models</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Thwarting Malicious Behavior</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Naming &amp; Addressing</li>

    <li>Establishment of Security Associations</li>

    <li>Securing Neighbor Discovery</li>

    <li>Secure Routing in Multi-hop Wireless Networks</li>

    <li>Privacy Protection </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h4><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+0">Prerequisites</font></font></h4>

<p>This course is primarily designed for Ph.D. students, but is
also open to M.S. students with the appropriatate background. The
prerequisites for
this class are CS 571 (Operating Systems) <strong>and</strong>
CS 555
(Computer Networks). Some background in security and cryptography is
desirable but not required.&nbsp; Students who have
not taken these courses but believe they are capable of handling
the requirements for the class can register for the class only after
getting
<strong>permission from the instructor.</strong> (Please
see me or send
me
email if you fall in this category)</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The lectures in class will be based mostly on the book "<a href="http://secowinet.epfl.ch/">Security &amp;
Cooperation in Wireless Networks</a>" by Buttyan and Hubaux, and
articles in the
research literature. Students will be required to read assigned papers
and submit (electronically) a critical assessment of each paper before
its presentation in class, and participate in class discussions on each
paper. &nbsp;The first four or five lectures&nbsp;will be
presented by the instructor. Subsequently, each
student will be required to give two presentations based on one or more
papers from the reading list.<br>

</p>

<p>Each student will also have to complete a course project. This
project could be a programming project or a research-oriented project
depending on the interests and capabilities of the student.<br>

</p>

<p>The grade for the class will be based on:<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li>Class participation and paper summaries (20%)</li>

  <li>Class presentations (30%)<br>

  </li>

  <li>Class project (50%)<br>

  </li>

</ul>

  <h4>Readings</h4>

</dl>

<p>There is no required textbook for this class. However, the
lectures in the first third of the semester will be based on <a href="http://secowinet.epfl.ch/">"Security &amp;
Cooperation in Wireless Networks"</a> by Buttyan and
Hubaux.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the lectures and discussion in class will be based on
articles in the research literature. Click <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/%7Esetia/cs818/reading.html">here</a>
for a
preliminary list of papers to be discussed and presented in class.</p>
