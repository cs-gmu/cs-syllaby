<p> <b>Class Attendance</b><br>
Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on time.&nbsp; I expect to start at 10:30 
  sharp, and possibly with a quiz!&nbsp; Please participate in class! Ask 
questions if there is something you don't understand. 
<p><b>Grading Policies</b><br>
  
There will also be written homeworks, in-class quizzes, 
  a in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. Both the final and midterm are closed-book 
  and closed-notes. The final exam will be <b>comprehensive</b>, i.e., it will 
cover the entire course. Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the 
exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the illness (doctor's note) is required.&nbsp; No 
early exams will be given and make-up exams are strongly discouraged. 
  <p></p>End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows (tentative 
plan): 
  
<ul>
    <li>45% Assignments and quizzes</li>
    <li>50% Exams </li>
      <UL>  
      <LI>20% midterm                 
      <LI>30% final 
    </UL>
    <li>5% Class participation</li></ul>
  
In order to obtain an A, your final score should be <i>at least</i> 90. A total score of 49 or less will result in 
an F. 
<p><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy</b></p>
Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 20% per day within 3 days after 
deadlines and will not be accepted three days after due, unless under 
prearranged conditions.
  
  <p> <b> <font color="#D50000">Honor Code</font></b><br>
  You are expected to abide by the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Please refer to <A HREF="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">
GMU Academic Policies</A> and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">

	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class. </b>
