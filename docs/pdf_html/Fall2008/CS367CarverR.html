<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This course provides an introduction to computer systems from a programmer's perspective. 
Topics include machine-level representation of data and programs, linking and loading, processes, 
virtual memory and memory allocation.<br>
</p>
<h2> Course Outcomes </h2>
<p> Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate an ability to design and implement C programs.</li>
<li>Demonstrate knowledge of computer arithmetic and logic operations and representations of data at the machine-level.</li>
<li>Demonstrate knowledge of machine-level representations of (C) programs.</li>
<li>Demonstrate an ability to use debuggers.</li>
<li>Demonstrate an understanding of object file linking and related ideas such as relocatable object files and symbol resolution.</li>
<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the idea of a process, how processes are created and laid out in memory, how processes use virtual memory, and how they are manipulated via interrupts, signals, and context  switches.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p> Grade of C or better in ECE 303, 331, or 445. (Same as 2007 prerequisites.) <br>
</p>
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>The required textbook for this class is Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective by Randal 
Bryant and David O'Hallaron (Prentice Hall,  2003).  A reference text for the C programming 
language is the classic Kernighan and Ritchie book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition, 
Prentice Hall, 1988).<br>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>The grade for the course will be based on the following components:
(i)
Programming and Homework Assignments (50%) (iii) Mid-term
exam (25%) (iii) Final exam (25%). 
<p>
Late Policy: For late submissions, points will be deducted as follows:
3% per day for the first three days, 10% per day after that.
<p>
All exams are closed book.
</p>
<h2>Programming Assignments</h2>
There will be two C programming assignments and three to four labs. The relative weight for each 
assignment is based on the amount of effort that is required. You may work in a group of up to two 
students on these assignments.
<br>
<p>You are expected to abide by the <a
 href="http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">University's
honor
code</a> during the semester. Any violation of the honor code will result in an F
for the
class.</p>
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>Office hours will be on Tuesday from 3:45-4:30pm in my
office (S &amp; T II Room 343), or by appointment. I'm usually
in my office before class.</p>
<h2>TA</h2>
<p>Raheem Rufai <br>
Office hours: Wedn 7:30 - 8:30pm, Thurs 7:30 - 8:30pm, ST2 room 365 <br>
Email: rrufai@gmu.edu 
<br>
</p>
<h2>Class Home Page</h2>
<p>All handouts and other course material will be available at the <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~rcarver/cs367/"></tt>367 home page.</a></p>
<h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
<p>If you're planning to use the computers on campus for doing your
projects,
please obtain an <a href="http://ite.gmu.edu/labs/">IT&amp;E labs</a>
account. Even if you are using your own computer, your programs need to
execute correctly on the Linux computers in the IT&amp;E lab since that
system will be used while grading your projects.<br>
</p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
please see me and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at 993-2474.
All academic accommodations must be arranged through the DRC.
