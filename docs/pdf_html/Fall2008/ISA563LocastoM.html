 <b>Prerequisites:</b> INFS 590 or permission of Instructor. I also
    assume you have access to a recent (2.6.x) Linux enviroment, a
    decent editor (such as emacs or vi) or IDE, and the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">gcc</a> compiler.
 <p>

 <b>Description:</b> This course is a hands-on in-depth introduction
    to the structure of the Unix operating system with emphasis to the
    system libraries using ANSI C. It is appropriate for students who
    want to learn the principles of how to design and implement system
    applications. The course begins with an introduction of the C
    programming language and continues with the basic Unix Operating
    System data structures and Application Programming Interfaces
    (APIs). Using hands-on laboratory exercises students will be
    exposed to the concepts of inter-process communications,
    synchronization, and process and thread management with emphasis
    on security applications. 
 <p>
 <b>Goals:</b> 
 <ul>
  <li>Demystify systems programming</li>
  <li>Focus on principles, methods, and tools</li>
  <li>Sound application design principles</li>
  <li>Efficient and Secure implementation strategies</li>
  <li>Concepts and mechanics of secure programming.</li>
  <li>UNIX operating system programming environment.</li>
  <li>Develop applications using popular tools and systems including C, UNIX, IPC, and threading.</li>
 </ul>

  If you're really interested in learning C and mastering it, then
  the Loudon book is a good second step. The Oualline book covers much of what
  Deitel<sup>2</sup> covers on C anyway.

 <p>
 The point of this course is your intellectual enlightenment and enjoyment.
 I want the course to run as smoothly as possible, so I encourage feedback
 on both positive and negative aspects. Feel free to drop by my office,
 send email, or leave a note. Note that the Instructor reserves the right
 to modify the schedule and topics as needed.
 <p>
 Your <b>grade</b> is based on 1000 points and is split according to the
 following schedule:
  <ul>
    <li> 40% homeworks</li>
    <li> 35% final exam</a></li>
    <li> 20% mini-project</li>
    <li> 5%  class participation </li>
  </ul>
 When your work is returned to you, check it. If you disagree about a
 particular solution, please document in writing what you think the
 grading mistake is. Please do not make immediate verbal complaints to
 the professor or TA.
 <p>
 <b>Class participation</b> counts toward your grade. I expect and
    encourage thoughtful and lively participation and discussion.
 <p>
 I typically DO NOT <b>scale</b> or <b>curve</b> grades unless there is
 a classwide epidemic of failure. Plan your work and effort based on the
 assumption that there will be no curve.
 <p>
 You can <b>contact me</b> via email, but please start your email's subject 
 with the string <code>[ISA563]</code>; it helps me filter my email. Short
 (one or two paragraphs) emails are appreciated.
 <p>
 While <b>collaboration</b> on homework and projects is greatly
 encouraged, your answers must be original. No collaboration is
 allowed on the final or midterm. Students collaborating on
 assignments must clearly list with whom they worked.  The bottom line
 is that general discussion is welcome, but specific solutions cross
 the line.
 <p>
 <b>Cheating and Plagiarism</b> are absolutely forbidden.  I assume
 that you have read GMU's policies on academic honesty.  Please refer
 to the links at the top of this page. It is almost absurdly easy to
 discover cheating.
 <p>
 <b>Late</b> work is generally not accepted. Late submission loses 10%
 of the assignment's value per day.
 <p>

 Disability Statement: If you have a documented learning disability or
 other condition that may affect academic performance you should make
 sure this documentation is on file with the Office of Disability
 Services: (SUB I, Rm. 222; 993-2474; www.gmu.edu/student/drc) to
 determine the accommodations you need and talk with me to discuss
 your accommodation needs.
