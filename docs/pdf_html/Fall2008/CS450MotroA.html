<h2> CS-450: Database Concepts </h2>
<h4> Fall 2008 --- Prof. Ami Motro</h4>
<hr>
<p>
This course covers basic and intermediate knowledge on the design,
implementation and use of relational database systems.  The main topics
include the Entity-Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER)
models for database design, the relational algebra, Structured Query Language
(SQL), SQL programming techniques, functional dependencies and normalization,
object and object-relational databases, and database security.  Students will
practice the design, development and implementation of a relational database
in the Oracle ssystem, and use the database for queries, transaction
processing and report generation.

<!--
This senior-level undergraduate course is an introductory course in the area
of databases, with a focus on <em> database models and languages</em>.  Topics
to be covered include: database design with the Entity-Relationship model, the
relational data model and its formal languages, SQL and database programming,
the theory of relational database design; additional topics will be covered as
time permits.<br>  Note: The advanced database
course <a href="../infs760/infs760.html"> INFS-760 </a>: Advanced Database
Management, is suggested for students who have completed CS-450 and are
interested in issues of <em>databse systems and implementation</em>.
