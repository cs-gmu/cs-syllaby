							<p>
								There are five recommended books for this couse, and can help
								with further understanding of the subjects. They are not at the
								Johnson Center Bookstore, but can be found online.

						</div>
						<div class="sectionText">
							<p>SWE 645 covers some of the topics related to 
							the software development models that are used to 
							support component-based software systems. 
							We will be studying the software design and 
							development side of component-based software.</p>

							<p>Though SWE 619 is the only required prerequisite, 
							other topics such as web based Java programming 
							(<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.jsp">Servlets</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JSPs</a>,...) and 
							database programming (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/overview.html">JDBC</a>) are going to 
							be used throughout this course. Therefore, background knowledge will be helpful.
							SWE 642, though not a required prerequisite, is a great background course for these topics.
							The class will be very practical (how to build things) and require extensive programming assignments.

							<div class="headerText">Homeworks:</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionText">
							<p>A number of homework assignments will 
							be given. I will discuss each in class and make the 
							assignment available on the class web site. You will submit 
							your solutions by sending an email to myself, and CC the TA. 
							The email will contain a description on how to run, or access your assignment,

							and a zip file containing all of your code. I reserve
							the right to deduct points if the description and/or zip file is not 
							included with the homework. Please read ALL of the assignment requirements, as
							they will contain important informaton, such as procedures and naming conventions.
							I will discuss how the assignments are to be deployed, and it will
							be contained in the assignment requirements.<br />
							Be sure that you are on the class mailing list, as refinements and 
							hints for the assignments will be sent through email. 
							Assignments will be checked immediately after the due date; 
							if you finish an assignment late, you must inform us by 
							email when it is ready for us to grade it. <b>Changing an 
							assignment after the due date without prior permission will
							be treated as a late submission.</b> Late submissions carry an automatic 10
							percent deduction in grade for each week that it is late. No homeworks will be 
							accepted after the start of the last lecture on 
							Week 14 (12/10/2008).</p>
							
							<p>Assingments will be graded on the correctness of the code and the
							adherance to the requirements. A more detailed description on the
							homework grading will be included with the homework requirements 
							when assigned.</p>
							
							<p>Since some of the assignments are web-based, it is
							your responsibility to have the homework assignements hosted. George Mason
							offers a JBoss application server to SWE 645 students as a convenience. However,
							if you would like to host your homework elsewhere, that is permitted, <b>as long
							as the TA and myself can access the assignment, and the server space where the assignment
							is hosted</b> (in other words, we need SSH access to the server). Here are a couple companies that host
							examples of Java EE and EJB applications:
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">http://www.rackspace.com/</a></li>
								<li><a href="http://www.visionwebhosting.net/">http://www.visionwebhosting.net/</a></li>
								<li><a href="http://www.eapps.com/ManagedHosting/JBoss.jsp">http://www.eapps.com/ManagedHosting/JBoss.jsp</a></li>
							</ul>
							I highly reccomend downloading, and installing, 
							the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads//">JBoss Applcation Server</a> on your own computer, 
							so that you can still complete
							your assignments, even if your application server, or Internet connection, is
							down. </p>

							<div class="headerText">Honor Code Statement:</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionText">
							<p class="p1"><span>As with all GMU courses, SWE 642 is 
							governed by the GMU Honor Code. In this course, all 
							assignments, exams, and project submissions carry with 
							them an implicit statement that it is the sole work of the 
							author, unless joint work is explicitly authorized. Help 
							may be obtained from the instructor or other students to 
							understand the description of the problem and any 
							technology, but the solution, particularly the design 
							portion, must be the student's own work. If joint work is 
							authorized, all contributing students must be listed on the 
							submission. Any deviation from this is considered an 
							Honor Code violation, and as a minimum, will result in 
							failure of the submission and as a maximum, failure of the 
							class. Honor code violation may include, but are not limited to
							the following examples:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Copying answers from other students during exams.</li>
								<li>Submitting homework that is not your own work.</li>				
								<li>Copying and pasting someone else's code into your own files (even with slight modifications)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The examples I show in class can be used to grow on, not to copy. 
							I understand that in the real world, software reuse is considered the norm, and can 
							drastically improve a projects schedule. However, in this class, software reuse 
							will be considered an Honor Code violation, unless permission is granted before 
							the project is submitted. When in doubt, ask me? It is better to find out what 
							I would consider a violation before the assignment is submitted. This is not the real world,
							and one of the requirements to passing this class is that you, the student, can handle the material
							on your own.</p>
