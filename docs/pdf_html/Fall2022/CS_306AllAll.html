    <p><b> Req'd Textbook: </b><i>Ethics and Law in Computing: Understanding
        the Legal Process and How Law and Ethics Impact Issues in Technology</i>
      (Geldon &amp; Maddox), Cognella, 2022. To order, go to: gmu.bncollege.com
    </p>
    <p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students
      become effective professionals in the field of computer science by
      examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding
      computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing
      with those challenges. Students will examine the philosophical bases for
      ethical decision-making and how to apply them to issues raised by
      computers and technology. Specific topics covered in CS 105/110, such as
      intellectual property concerns, will be addressed by this course in a more
      intensive manner. Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the
      computer profession and e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is
        a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much of
        our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
        dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
        chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
        apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
        opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
        may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
        and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that you
        will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU
          are the most important component of this class, so please come
          prepared to think, discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At
          the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you
          disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>
    <p align="justify"><b>Course Outcomes:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in
        computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.</li>
      <li>Be able to connect issues of computer technology to wider community
        and societal concerns using perspectives of law, ethics and computer
        science.</li>
      <li>Be able to communicate effectively in oral form.</li>
      <li>Be able to communicate effectively in written form.</li>
      <li>Be able to work with a partner and/or group to satisfy a complex task.</li>
      <li>Be able to apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the quality,
        credibility and limitations of an argument or a solution using
        appropriate evidence or resources.</li>

        (for Prof. Otten) and Zoom (for Prof. Geldon).&nbsp; While Sections
        -003, -008 and -009 will meet in person, all students will have certain
        asynchronous requirements as well as many materials and assignments that
        will require BB access to complete. </b>All students will need to be
      prepared for the following technology requirements to successfully
      complete this class:
      <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">

    <p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a Writing Intensive (WI)
      Course that, together with CS 321, meets the GMU WI Requirements for the
      BS CS and BS ACS programs. Accordingly, each student in CS 306 is required
      to write a minimum of 1750 individual words, which will be graded and
      returned to the student with feedback. This requirement will be
      fulfilled&nbsp;by two essays, one of which will analyze legal and ethical
      issues and which will require both a draft and final submission, each
      graded separately.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-style: italic;">The final
          version of both </span>essays&nbsp;must meet minimum word-count
        requirements <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> earn a final
        grade of C or better in order to receive a C or better in the course.</b>
      Students will also be writing an in-class essay exam and will work with
      partners to research and write materials in preparation for
      their&nbsp;Mock Trials.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Grading Policy:</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Class Participation (incl. short preparation
      assignments) (10%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Short quizzes on assigned reading and recent lecture
      material (10%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Discussion Board assignments (5%)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Essay 1 (500 words) (5%)<br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work: &nbsp;You are expected to submit
      all work by the due date. &nbsp;</span>Late work may be accepted at the
    discretion of the instructor, but &nbsp;will be subject to a late penalty,
    typically 5-10% per day (incl. weekends).<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;The group project is divided into several parts, and no late
      work&nbsp;will be accepted after the due date for the next sequential
      part. &nbsp;NO late work of any kind will be accepted for credit after
      Saturday, Dec. 3, 2022. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Attendance:</span>&nbsp; You should assume ALL normally scheduled classes
    are synchronous and require attendance unless specifically told
    otherwise.&nbsp; Certain class sessions will be asynchronous (not requiring
    class attendance), but these will be clearly announced in advance.&nbsp;
    Students should plan to attend ALL synchronous classes (either in person or
    by logging in through Zoom/BBCU), prepared to participate and ready to
    discuss the readings and/or recorded lecture assignments for that day.&nbsp;
    Failure to do so will be reflected in your class participation grade.&nbsp;
    (Students unable to attend class due to emergency or covid-19 quarantine
    should contact their instructor immediately to make special arrangements for
    any missed classes.)&nbsp; Group project grading may include a confidential
    review of participating group members by each student, and individual grades
    may be adjusted later in the semester if deemed appropriate based on
    repeated lack of participation as evidenced by either instructor observation
    or report by fellow group members. <b>If an assignment requires inclusion
