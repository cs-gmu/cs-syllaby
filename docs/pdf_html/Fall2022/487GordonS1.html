  <h2 class="title">Course Overview</h2>
  <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
      The course will provide an introduction to modern cryptography.
      We will cover many practical topics, such as how to correctly
      use block ciphers and hash functions for the most common tasks:
      encryption and message authentication, the differences
      between public key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography,
      and a few ways to build public key encryption and signatures.
      We will learn about how to properly define security, and how to
      prove that our constructions are secure.  In addition, with what
      time we remains, we may cover several recent topics in
      cryptography, such as the use of blockchains for crypto
      currencies, and securely computing on private data. </p>
      
    <p> <em><strong>Objectives</strong></em><br>
      The main objectives are to convey the importance
      of <em>provable</em> security, to teach students how to use
      cryptographic tools in a way that is provably secure, to
      provide students with the ability to decide whether a
      protocol is secure, and to demonstrate the range of what can be
      achieved with provable security.  </p>

    <p> <em><strong>Course Outcomes</strong></em><br>
	Students taking this class will: (a) be able to understand the
	security properties achieved by common cryptographic
	mechanisms such as encryption or digital signatures, (b) be
	familiar with a number of cryptographic primitives
	available to solve a variety of problems, (c) gain
	some experience with how these cryptographic tools can be used to secure
	modern systems.   
      
    <p> <em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
      CS 330, CS 310, and STAT 344.  More generally, 
      students should have some level of mathematical
      maturity.  Students should be comfortable writing proofs, and
      should have comfort with basic probability theory.   </p>

    </blockquote>
    <h3> Logistics </h3>
    <blockquote>
             <p><em><strong>Office Hours</strong></em><br>
		 I will hold office hours in-person, in my office, on Tuesdays
		 and Wednesdays.  (Time, TBA here.) These sessions
		 will be streamed on Zoom as well, and I will post
		 links to
		 recordings on piazza.  Occasionally, by announcement,
      I will instead hold my Tuesday office hours 
      virtually.
      My office hours should be viewed as study sessions: homework is
      almost always due on Wednesday at class time, and I will help
      you with the homework in my office hours.  All are
      welcome at the same time! I'll take questions and we'll work through problems
      together.  For
      students that expect to struggle with the material, I
      strongly encourage you to attend at least one, and preferably both hours
      each  week.  If you lose points on a homework, you should see
      this as an indication that you need help, and you should try to
      attend office hours.  The TA will also hold hours, and he is
      able to help you in the same manner.   To speak to me privately, please
      email me ahead of time so we can schedule something.
 
 

      
      	 </p>

 	   <p><em><strong>Piazza</strong></em><br>
	       <b>All class announcements will be made on Piazza.</b>
	       I will answer all questions on Piazza.
	       My email inbox is typically swamped, and
	       anything sent there has a good chance of being missed.
	       If you do email me, put 487/587 in the subject line.
	       But better is to message me on piazza.  Students are
	       encouraged to post homework questions on piazza!  I realize that some posts need to be private,
	       but when in doubt, I encourage you to <b>make your
	       posts public!</b>  Everyone will benefit from your
	       questions, and I prefer that we all learn from them.
	       Generally, I'm not that worried about questions that
	       give hints.  (Within reason.)    
	       
	   
	   <p><em><strong>Gradescope</strong></em><br>
	       Quizzes, homeworks and
	       exams will all be submitted through Gradescope.
	       You can find gradescope through Blackboard:
	       click on Tools, then gradescope.  You should also be
	       able to access it directly from the gradescope website,
	       if you use your GMU login.   When submitting an
	       assignment, <b>please</b> mark each question with the
	       appropriate question number, as this makes grading much
	       easier.


	   <p><em><strong>Overleaf</strong></em><br>
	       I will release some assignments on overleaf. This is a
	       web-based platform for writing latex documents.  You do
	       not need special software, and I will not insist that
	       you use latex to write your answers.  You can simply
	       view the PDF from the webpage, and submit answers to
	       Gradescope in whatever format you like.  However,
	       I <b>encourage</b> you to use latex - it is fairly
	       easy, and produces nice PDFs.  To do that, just copy
	       the project that I've shared, and edit.  You still
	       submit the resulting PDF through Gradescope.

	   
	   
	   
       <p><em><strong>Lecture Videos</strong></em><br>
	   Students are expected to watch videos each week, prior to
	   the class meeting time.  In the meeting, I will review
	   questions about those videos, and we will work through
	   related problems.  Links to the videos can be found below,
	   under the class schedule. </p>

  <h2 class="title">Course Requirements</h2>

  <h3>Homework</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There will be roughly 10 homework assignments. Homework will be due
    <b>at class time</b> on Wednesdays.  All assignments will be
    posted on this page, below, and are to be submitted through
    Gradescope.  Some assignments will require written responses, while
    others will require python submissions using the <a href="https://ucsdcse107.github.io/playcrypt/">playcrypt</a> framework. 
    I intend to make a VM available to help with installation, though
    the installation is fairly simple in any linux environment.  Students are welcome to work in groups, but <em>every student
    must write/code their solutions independently.</em>  Homework that
    appear overly similar will be considered to violate the honor
    code.    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     There will be one midterm and one final exam.  The better score
     will count more heavily towards your final grade.  The final
     mostly covers the 2nd half.  However, I may include some
     material from the first half if I feel students did not
     understand it sufficiently well.  I will inform
     you ahead of time if I choose to do this. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
     Quizzes are short: 1-2 questions, multiple choice or
     fill-in-the-blank. They will be administered through 
    Gradescope.    Each
     single quiz is worth < 1% of your grade. They will be released on
     Friday, and due by the start of class on Wednesday. Each will cover
     the videos that were intended to be watched at home, in
     preperation for the lecture to come.  They mainly 
     serve to help me gauge what the students have understood from the
     videos, and
     what needs further explanation.  </p>
    </blockquote>

<h3>CS 587</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Students in CS 587 will be be given extra homework problems on
    most homeworks, and an extra problem on each of the exams.  They
      will also have to read Chapter 7 independently.</p>
    </blockquote>

    
  <h3>Grading</h3>
  <blockquote>
    	  Quizzes -- 10%.  The lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. <br>
	  Homeworks -- 30%.  The lowest two homework
	  grades will be dropped. <br>  
	  <!-- Programming assignment -- 20% <br> -->
	  Midterm Exam -- 25% or 35%. <br>
	  Final Exam --  35% or 25%. <br>
	  (The better exam score will count for 35%) 	  </blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Do I curve?  The short answer is yes.  The more accurate answer is
  more subtle.  I do not force the final grades to fit any kind of
  curve.  Doing this would require a certain  number of A's and a
  certain number of F's.  I do not believe that there must be some
minimum  number of failures, or
  that there should be some maximum number of A's. (Before you
  get too excited, the 
  symmetric argument is valid as well.)</p>

  <p>When the final exam is
  graded, I will re-weight everyone's score according the weights
  described above, and I will sort them.  I will then look to draw
  lines where there are clear gaps in the scores.  For example, it is possible that
  an 83 will get an A, and an 81 will not.  To help give you a sense
  of where you stand, after the midterm, I will give a histogram of
  score projections, and a spreadsheet that allows you to see how you
  will compare to those projected scores based on how you perform on
  the remaining assignments.</p>     </blockquote>
