    </p>
    <h3>1.1 Textbook: <a href="https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/GMUCS112NearySummer2019">zyBooks</a></h3>
	<p><b>Required -</b> <b>Zyante </b>online textbook.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign up</li>
        <li>Enter zyBook code: <b>GMUCS112NearySummer2020</b></li> 
        <li>Subscribe using any credit card (Students that retake the course contact support@zybooks.com to have the book added to your library for <b>free</b>)</li>
        <li>This semester we are using the 'ZyLabs' component of the online book, which incurs an additional fee.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Communication:</h3>

    <h4><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Discord is a online text and voice chat system originally designed for gaming. I am piloting a server for this course since we are 100% online. Think of it like Microsoft Teams / Slack, but free!</li>
      <li>This will be the fastest way to ask me questions; I am online at all hours of the day. We will be trying office hours on this platform as well.</li>
      <li>Instructions on how to join will be sent to you via email.</li>
      <li>We will still maintain a course Piazza for announcements, updates, etc. that should be somewhere permanently</li>
    </ul>

    <h4> <a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/summer2020/cs112"><b>Piazza</b></a></h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Here, you can find the course schedule, announcements, lecture slides, assignments,
        and other discussion.</li>
      <li>All correspondence will go through Piazza. You can send
        private messages to the instructors (visible to all professors and the GTA) as well as post public questions visible to all
        students, collaborate on responses, and tag everything by topic.</li>
      <li>Unless you have a confidential matter to discuss directly with
        an individual professor/TA, please do not email us directly --
        use a private piazza post. <i>Project help
        questions sent via email are of extremely low priority, as
        they were sent to the wrong place and will most likely be
		responded to with "please post on Piazza".</i></li>
      <li><b>The discussion board on Piazza is required reading for all
        projects</b>. You MUST read the discussion board for
        clarifications and project updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>1.3 </b><a href="https://gradescope.com"><b>Gradescope</b></a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You will submit programming assignments to Gradescope for easy autograding.</li>
      <li>You will get feedback on your assignments from the TAs on this platform.</li>
      <li>You should have received an email invite to this platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>1.4 </b><a href="https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/"><b>Blackboard</b></a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grades will be posted to Blackboard.</li>
      <li>The majority of online video sessions will be conducted through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra (unless otherwise noted).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><b>1.5 </b><a href="http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit"><b>Python Tutor</b></a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We will rely heavily on the Python Visualizer to show various Programming concepts.</li>
      <li>This will help you tremendously when debugging your own code.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>A+ (&gt;= 98.0%) A (&gt;= 92.0%) A– (&gt;= 90.0%)</li>
      <li>B+ (&gt;= 88.0%) B (&gt;= 82.0%) B– (&gt;= 80.0%)</li>
      <li>C+ (&gt;= 78.0%) C (&gt;= 72.0%) C– (&gt;= 70.0%)</li>
      <li>D (&gt;= 60.0%)</li>
      <li>F (&lt; 60.0%)</li>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.1 Individual Projects</h3>
    <p>Programming projects will be a primary focus of your grade - each
      one should take multiple sessions of coding, with questions asked
      in between. This is the practice you need to learn, master, and
      internalize various concepts of the course. Don't be surprised if
      you're spending 5-20 hours on each one. All project grades will be
      averaged together evenly.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Gradescope Submission</h3>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>All projects are to be submitted to Gradescope. You can
          submit your work an unlimited number of times to Gradescope,
          and by default only the last version will be graded.</li>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files will result in a zero. You
          can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that
          you turned in a working copy.</li>
        <li>Gradescope being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in
          a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
          somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the
          student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the
          deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
        <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
          extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
          service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
          it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
          stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
          forgot to (frequently) back up your work!</li>
        <li>GMU offers <a href="https://its.gmu.edu/service/office-365-onedrive/">free Microsoft OneDrive accounts</a> to students, so there is no excuse!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Deadlines and Emergency-Days</h3>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Each project has a posted deadline.</li>
        <li>The latest you can turn in work is 24 hours after the
		  posted deadline, no exceptions.</li>
        <li>The last project may not be turned in late, to facilitate
		  end-of-semester grading.</li>
        <li>Late submission lowers the
          maximum score on an assignment by <b>20%</b> (not quite the same as a 20%
          penalty: recorded_grade = min(raw_score, 80)).</li>
        <li>Each student gets <b>four</b> Emergency-Days, which
          are automatically used by late submissions. Each emergency-day
		  allows you to avoid a single 24-hour period of penalties.</li>
		<li>Even if you use emergency-days, you still must turn in work
		  within 24 hours of the original deadline! (Note that
		  this means you can't use all of your emergency-days on a single
		  project)</li>
        <li>Emergency-days can only be used on programming projects; they can't be
		  used on labs, readings, or exams.</li>
        <li>Turning in 1 minute late and turning in 23 hours and 59 minutes
		  late are treated the same (and therefore there are no
		  "half emergency-days" and no "partial late penalties").</li>
        <li>Unused emergency-days will be worth a small bounty at the
          semester's end (0.25% of the semester grade, for at most a 1% bump in your grade). This is a reward
		  for working and planning ahead during the semester.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a name="broken_code"></a>Broken Code == Bad Scores<br>
        </h3>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>After the first two projects, any code turned in that does
          not run (immediately crashes due to errors), specifically on
          Python 3.7, will receive at most 50%. No exceptions. At this
          point, if the grader is able to quickly fix your code, you
          might get some points back. If the grader cannot immediately
          spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate to get any points
          at all.</li>
        <li>Turning in code that runs is a big deal!</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Honor Code: Special Notes for Projects</h3>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming projects are considered individual efforts,
          therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of problem
          solutions are allowed with anyone except the TAs or the
          professor. Student projects will be manually and automatically
          assessed for cheating via similarity checking software. <b><font color="#cc0000">You may not
          look at or otherwise view any other individual's code,
          pseudocode, or algorithms that pertain to a programming project.</font></b></li>
        <li>You may not use any Internet resources to create code or
          algorithms, besides the textbooks, the slides, and Piazza,
          unless otherwise specified. However, you are free to look up
          the syntax errors your encounter online, to gain an
          understanding of what the syntax error means. The projects
          we're doing this semester can be directly solved using
          techniques discussed in class, and no outside material is
          needed unless otherwise noted.<font color="#cc0000"><b> Believe me, I know about all of them.</b></font></li>
        <li><b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
          a password, to not post your code to websites like Pastebin
          that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
          computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
          computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
          your code. </li>
		<li>See <a href="#honor_code">Honor code</a> section below for
		  more details.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
	<h3>2.2 Labs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All lab assessment grades will be averaged together. Lab
        assessments will be weekly quizzes or in-lab tasks, to be
        completed during lab.<br></li>
      <li>Any missed lab quiz/task is simply missed, regardless of the
        reason why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major
        award, getting married, saving the universe, etc.).&nbsp; Two
        lowest lab grades will be dropped to cover the cases
        of understandable missed labs.</li>
      <li>If you choose to miss some early on, and later on have to miss
        for some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save the
        drops so you can actually throw out a bad grade, and not just
        hide a lazy zero. Pretending you don't have them is your best
        approach.</li>
      <li>I do not intend to strictly enforce the Honor Code for lab assignments. 
        You may work collaboratively with others in the course on these assignments
      as long as you state who you worked with. However, you still may not copy code from the internet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.3 Zyante (Zybook) Readings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Zyante readings are graded based on the completion percentage
        of activities <b>before the designated deadline</b> of each
        chapter.</li>
      <li>See the schedule page on Piazza for reading assignment due
        date.</li>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font
            face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Make sure you're logged
            in to get credit for reading completion.</font></font></li>
      <li>Optional subsections are not considered for Zyante grading.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.5 Exams</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exam parameters will be announced closer to the exam dates.</li>
      <li>The final exam is cumulative. If you perform better on the
        final exam than your midterm exam, I will replace the midterm grade
        with the final grade.</li>
      <li>If you know in advance that you are unable to take an exam for
        a valid and unavoidable reason (such as a scheduled surgery,
        etc.), you must notify the professor at least one week before the
        scheduled exam date to make arrangements for a make-up, and
        bring documentation with you when you take the make-up. </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero.</li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).</li>
      <li>Per departmental policy, you must pass a significant exam
	    threshold to receive a passing grade in this class, regardless
	    of your performance on other assignments. Failing the final exam
	    (&lt;60.0%), will result in a failing grade (F) for the entire
	    course unless you have achieved an average exam score &gt;=65%.
	    This average score is calculated as a <b>weighted</b> average of
	    your exam scores (((15*Labs) + (15*Midterm) + (25*Final))/55).
	    Note that midterm grades will not be "replaced" with the final
	    grade for this calculation. In short, in 99/100 cases,
	    <b><font color="#ff6600">you must pass the final exam to pass the course</font></b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.6 Contested Grades</h3>
	<p>If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
        grader. For all homework, projects, and lab work, that is your GTA.
		For exams, that is your professor. Contesting of
		grades on any/all submissions must be requested within three days
		of receiving the grade (on BlackBoard). No grade changes will
		be considered subsequent to that deadline.</p>
		
    <h2>3 Office Hours and Discussion Board</h2>
	<p>There is substantial support available to you outside of lecture time
	  in the form of office hours and the online discussion boards (Discord/Piazza).
	  If you are having difficulty on a project or lab, we encourage you to
	  reach out <b>as early as possible</b>. That said, to ensure fairness
	  and facilitate learning, we have some basic rules for seaking help
	  outlined below.</p>
	<p>Please note that the is a discussion forum for you, the students,
	  to discuss the course and the course material. It is monitored regularly by the GTA and your professor, but this is NOT a replacement for office hours, lecture with your professor, or labs.</p>
	<h3>3.1 Rules for Office Hours</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For students seeking help with programming assignments during
        office hours, students must identify the line number, through
        debug print statements, where they believe an error to be before
        seeing the TA or instructor. This implies that you must have at
        least one test case that fails, to bring to office hours before
        the TAs or instructor can help you.</li>
      <li>For more general programming assignment questions, students
        must bring their own pseudocode to office hours before the TA or
        professor can help you.</li>
      <li>Under no circumstances will the professor or GTA reveal more
        than three lines of code at a time during office hours. Students
        must make significant, individual effort on all projects before
        coming to see a GTA/professor. Waiting until the last minute, in
        the expectations that the entire project will be explained in
        one office hours session, is not feasible.</li>
      <li>Office hours are often crowded - do not rely on them for last
        minute help, as we cannot guarantee that we will be able to
        spend significant time with every student.</li>
	  <li>If you have any questions about what you are/aren't permitted
	    to do on a project/lab and you and the TA cannot find a the answer
		written somewhere, you should ask your professor. <b>"So-and-so said"
		will not be an accepted as a reason for grade re-evaluations</b>
		(unless "so-and-so" is your professor).</li>
	  <li>Your time in professor office hours will be limited depending on
	      amount of people who are seeking help. You may be asked to leave
	      and come back later so that everyone can have a chance to ask a question.
	      <b>Office hours are not a place to camp out and work on your assignments</b>, 
	      you must bring specific questions or know specifically what you are having
	      trouble with. </li>
	  <li>Students often forget that office hours are also a time to get clarification
	      on concepts we have covered in class, so don't forget that you can ask more questions than just "my project doesn't work and I think the problem is on line X, am I right?". We are happy to answer conceptual questions.</li>
    </ul>
	<h3>3.1 Rules for the Discussion Board</h3>
    <ul>
	  <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, Piazza,
        to ask and answer questions about assignments, labs, course material,
		etc.</li>
      <li>No sharing answers or code solutions to assignments on the
        discussion board. See <a href="#honor_code">Honor code</a>
        section below for more details.</li>
      <li>Students can post questions and code privately, although the
        instructor reserves the right to make any post public, so that
        other students can see the responses. </li>
      <li>For students wishing to post their code privately to Piazza,
        the same rules apply as when coming to office hours; if you have
        code written, you must produce at least one failing test case
        where you have identified what line number is giving you
        problems.</li>
      <li>There are no UTAs assigned to CS112 this summer. Therefore, responses to questions can be expected <b>within 36 hours</b>, though often times much sooner.</li>
      <li>Statements made on the discussion boards, even by TAs and
	    especially by other students, should NOT be considered the
		definitive word on the subject unless it is verified by your
		professor (in the assignment description, in class, posted on
		Piazza, etc.).</li>
	  <li>If you have any questions about what you are/aren't permitted
	    to do on a project/exam and you/others cannot find a the answer
		written somewhere, you should ask your professor. <b>"So-and-so said"
		will not be an accepted as a reason for grade re-evaluations</b>
		(unless "so-and-so" is your professor).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4 <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font> <a name="honor_code"></a></h2>
    <ul>
	  <li>The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our
	    academic culture. A degree from this institution should be a
		direct measure of your own progress and abilities, and as such
		at all times we must ensure that all work that should be your
		own is your own. </li>
      <li>All students are expected to abide by the <a
        href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor
        Code</a>. This policy is rigorously enforced.</li>
      <li>The computer science department has an <a
        href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
        Policies</a> to understand better what constitutes cheating in
		the CS setting. It clarifies some scenarios that are unique
		to our sorts of assignments. Note that the CS department doesn't
		have any "extra" policy for the honor code on top of the
		university's, this document merely helps you to understand
		how the honor code applies to programming and CS but it doesn't
		actually restrict it at all.</li>
      <li>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
        copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
        honor code simply will not be tolerated. Cheating will be
        prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee
        as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,
        collaboration, or looking at any code or algorithm related to
        programming projects that is not your own is considered
        cheating. <b>This includes using code found on the
		internet.</b></font></li>
      <li>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste
	    work from a friend, or even to just work on the project on your
		own machines next to each other, remember that it is just as
		easy to compare your work automatically and electronically,
		and discover the similarities in text and structure. We use
		automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then
        review them to find the cases that must be submitted to the
        Office of Academic Integrity.
	  <li>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a
	    zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed
		cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.</li>
	  <li>Please read <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~marks/honor.txt">
	    Understanding the Honor Code</a> - Dr. Snyder's thoughts about
		the purpose of the honor code in a computer science course.</li>
	  <li>There are definitely opportunities to study, work, and learn 
        together throughout this course - Zyante questions, lab exercises, 
        and more. Mostly you will need to work independently for any sort 
        of "test" and for projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5 The Office of Disability Services</h2>
    <p>Students with a learning disability or other condition
      (documented with GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of
        Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance
      should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss appropriate
      accommodations. Even if you don't know whether you plan on
      utilizing the accommodations for any assignment/test, it's in your
      best interest to prepare and get documented ahead of time.</p>
