<h2>Course Description</h2>
This course is a continuation of CS 211 and is intended to provide
you with more of the basic tools and techniques that facilitate software development.  You will
gain further exposure to object-oriented techniques, features of the Java language and  
additional experience with complex data structures and recursion.
This course is programming intensive.
<p>
Course topics include, but are not limited to the following:
<ul>
<li> Trees 
<li> Heaps, Heap sort and  Priority Queues
<li> Complexity Analysis
<li> Tries
<li> Data Compression
<li> Recursive sorting algorithms
<li> Graphs
</ul>

<h2> Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in CS 211.</h2>


<h2> Textbooks</h2>
<UL>
<li>Required: <cite>Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java</cite> by Mark Allen Weiss, 3rd Edition
<li>Recommended: <cite>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</cite> by Robert Lafore, 2nd Ed,
Sams Publishing (covers same topics)
<li>Recommended:  <cite> Bulletproof Unix</cite>, T. Gottleber (if new to unix;linux)
<li>Recommended: <cite> Java How to Program (6th edition)</cite>,
                                     by Deitel and Deitel (good Java book)
</ul>


<h2> Course Work </h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Grading: </b> 
<ul>
<li>Programming 44%<br>
You will be given several  major  data structure oriented programming assignments of
medium complexity, and optionally several minor programming assignments, which will count less . Work will 
be submitted electronically. 
<p> Late programming assignments will be penalized 10% percent per day. This means that if you turned in a project that received a grade of 80 but was
three days late, you would get a 56 (.70 * 80). Major projects can be no more than 3 days late,
 minor ones, only one day late. After that they will not be graded.  Late programs are not eligible for extra credit options if they are available.
You will have approximately 4 weeks for each major project and are expected to begin working on the project when assigned.   You will receive partial 
credit for any portions of your program that you can demonstrate work correctly.Consequently, individual requests for extensions will not be granted.<br>
<br>

<li>Homework and Quizzes  12% <br>
Some
assignments may involve some programming but will be less intensive than
the regular programming assignments. Assignments will not be accepted late;
no-makeup quizzes are allowed. 
<br><p>
<li>Midterm(20%) and Final(24%)<br>
You must pass the Final to get a C or above in this course.
</ul><br>
<li><b>Incomplete: </b> <p>A request for an incomplete (IN) will only be considered in the final quarter of the course (all assignments up to and including the 2nd project must have been turned in and no additional work on these will be accepted). Request must be made in writing, accompanied by a note from a doctor or employer and applicable contact information.<br><Br>
<li><b>Missing an Exam or Contesting a grade:</b>  <p>Once projects grades are sent to you or posted, you have one week to contest the grade.  After that the grade will not be changed.  
You must have a written excuse (doctor's note, for example) to miss a test.  Once a test or quiz is returned, you have
     one week to contest the grade-- beyond that the grade will not be changed. Note that the week starts when a test is returned to the class, which may or may not be when
     you choose to pick yours up. The Dean's permission is required for taking a missed Final Exam.<br><Br>

<li> <b>Extra Credit: </b> <br>
<p>  Extra credit programming points do no carry over to test grade points or vice-versa.
</ul>




<h2> Communications </h2>

We will use <a href="http://webct41.gmu.edu"> WebCt</a> and Unix e-mail for official communication. You are responsible for checking the system regularly for notices from your instructor or TA. <p>You MUST obtain a mason
account if you do not have one.
Please use this account for any individual correspondence with your instructor
and/or TA.&nbsp; (GMU faculty members have been instructed not to respond
to student email originating from a non-GMU account.)


<h2> Programming Policies </h2>
Unless otherwise stated, assignments are to be <i>individual efforts</i>, meaning that no code sharing or
discussion of problem solutions with anyone except your instructor or a TA.  You may not incorporate code written by others, such as can be found on the Internet or
any of the numerous CS books.  Documentation is required.<p>
You *may*, however, ask questions
or respond to queries on WebCT regarding projects or other assignments,
so long as you do not post any code or pseudocode, and so long as you
do not provide specific solutions to the overall problem or algorithm design
(even in English). <i>"Summarizing"</i> WebCT statements or responses to another
student verbally regarding an assignment are *not* acceptable, and are
subject to the above ban on discussing assignment solutions.&nbsp; Such
discussion or code sharing constitutes an honor code violation. </i>Suspected
honor code violations will be reported to the Honor Committee.&nbsp; (For
further information regarding honor code violations in programming, see
the Computer Science department's Honor Code statement.)
<p>You will be given credit only for code that works.  This means
that you should code and test functions as you write them, not code the
whole thing and then try to get it to work. 
<p> 
<p>
  Students must have an account on <TT>osf1.gmu.edu</TT>.
 You are <b>expected</b> to backup and submit/resubmit your program as you get different pieces working. The submit program keeps
the last 2 versions you submit.  Failure to do this may result in your getting 
a zero on a program instead of partial credit if last minute problems occur.
Note that accidently deleting your program, having problems connecting,
problems compiling, etc., <B> 
will not be accepted as excuses.</b> It is important that you <b>not </b>touch your
programs once you have done your final submission: if there are submission
problems, consideration for credit will only be given if your name and section is at the top of all source files and if it can be verified that the programs
were not changed after being submitted.  
<br>






<h2>Special Accommodations </h2>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see your instructor and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at 993-2474.  All academic accommodations must be arranged through the DRC.
<br> <br>


<h2>Honor Code</h2>
You are expected to abide by the honor code.  Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts.
Information on the university honor code can be found at:

Programs may be checked for cheating by any means available.  Questions concerning cheating violations will be
sent to the Honor Council.

<h2>Software </h2>
If you program at home, you will need to download <a href ="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html"> Java 1.5.0</a>.  It is recommended that you download the  <a href = "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download-netbeans.html"> JDK 5.0 Update 10 with NetBeans IDE 5.5 Bundle. </a> <a href = "http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is another free IDE.  It is not
required that you use either of these tools.
