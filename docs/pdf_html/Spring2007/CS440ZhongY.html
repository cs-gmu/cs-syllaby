<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Overview</font></b>
<br>This course will cover the theoretical and implementation aspects 
of language processing. Emphasis will be on the techniques and the issues that arise in the design and construction of compilers. There 
are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this course.&nbsp; 
Main topics of the course include:</p>
<UL>
    <LI> Compiler Design</font></LI>
    <LI>Lexical Analysis</LI>
    <LI>Syntax Analysis - grammars, LL(1) parsers, LR(1) parsers</LI>
    <LI>Semantic Processing</LI>
    <LI>Code generation and optimization </LI>
  </UL>
  
<p><b><font size="3">Prerequisites: C or better in CS 310, CS 330, CS 365</font></b><br>
<font face="Times New Roman">Students are expected to be acquainted with formal 
models and languages(CS330), computer structures and assembly languages(CS365), 
and data structures(CS310).&nbsp; Students should 
have fair programming skills in C or C++.</font>

<p> <b>Class Attendance</b><br>
Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on time.&nbsp; I expect to start at 7:20 
  sharp, and possibly with a quiz!&nbsp; Please participate in class! Ask 
questions if there is something you don't understand. 
<p><b>Grading Policies</b><br>
  
Tentative plans call for 3 to 4 programming assignments, together 
  worth 45% of your grade.&nbsp; These are to be individual efforts, meaning no sharing 
  of code allowed with anyone but the instructor or the TA. Expect substantial 
  programming workload. There will also be written homeworks, in-class quizzes, 
  a in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. Both the final and midterm are closed-book 
  and closed-notes. Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the 
exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the illness (doctor's note) is required.&nbsp; No 
early exams will be given and make-up exams are strongly discouraged. 
  <p></p>End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows: 
  
<ul>
    <li>55</font>% Assignments
</li>
    <UL>
      <li>45% programming assignments
      <LI>10% writing assignments
         
    </UL>
    <li>40% Exams
      </font> 
      <UL>  
      <LI>15% midterm                 
      <LI>25% final 
    </UL>
    <li>5% Class participation and quizzes
  </ul>
  
Letter grades will be assigned by subjectively identifying brackets 
in the numeric scores.&nbsp; A total score of 49 or less will result in F. 
<p><b><a name="Late"></a>Late Policy</b></p>
<b>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION FOR ILLNESS</b>, with the following exception: 
every student of the course is allowed to have a total of <b>3 FREE LATE DAYS</b>.&nbsp; Consider them as non-transferable, non-replaceable credits and use them wisely.&nbsp; If you wish to use one or more of these, indicate it clearly in your submission.&nbsp; No partial late day is in effect. You need one whole late day to cover a one-hour 
late submission.&nbsp; Late submissions will not be graded if you have used all three 
late days.&nbsp; <b>Partial credits</b> are available as long as you document well which 
parts have been implemented. 
<p><b>Extra Credit</b><br>
There may be opportunities for extra credit on some of the projects 
or exams.&nbsp; To receive any extra credit for a project, all base functionality 
of a project must be implemented; extra credit portions of a project can not count 
in place of required features.&nbsp; Extra extensions other than your late days 
will not be given for completion of extra credit.<h1> 
  
  <p> <b> <font color="#D50000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Honor Code</font></b><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are expected to abide by the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments 
  and exams are individual efforts. Collaborations on any programming assignment 
	is unacceptable.&nbsp; Please refer to <A HREF="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">
GMU Academic Policies</A>and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
	Computer Science Department Honor Code</a>.&nbsp; Any violation of the honor code will result in a zero of the 
	assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class. 
 
  <P><font color="#0000FF">I will be using </font>
	<b><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">MOSS</a></b><font color="#0000FF"> to 
	detect plagiarism in programming assignments.
