<B><P>Course Description: </B>This course is intended to help students become effective professionals in the field of computer science by examining many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those challenges.&nbsp; Students will examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how to apply them to issues raised by computers and technology.&nbsp; Specific topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns and software liability issues, will be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner.&nbsp; Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce will also be addressed. </P>
<P>Students will investigate the role of ethics for the computer professional in various situations through individual and group work. Students should be prepared to participate during class activities and to interact with their classmates. Students will refine their personal points of view on various ethical issues and consider how such issues - and their own views - impact on professional colleagues, clients and the general public. </P>
