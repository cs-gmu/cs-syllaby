<h2>Course Content</h2>
Study of computational models of visual perception and and their
implementation in computer systems. Topics include:
<ul>
<LI>Image formation
<LI>Binary vision systems: segmentation and connected components,
pattern recognition 
<LI>Grey scale vision systems: edge and corner detection, matching
<LI>3-D Vision: geometry of image formation, camera calibration,
stereo, recognizing 3d objects from models
<LI>Motion and navigation: video image processing and time-varying
image analysis
<LI>Forming and analyzing color images 
</UL>
Applications to
<ul>
<li>  video surveillance
<li>  human motion analysis
<li>  gesture recognition and human-computer interaction
<li>  intelligent highways
</ul>
are presented. 
<br> <br> All programming assignments will be done in
<i>Matlab</i>. You will learn all you need to know about Matlab in class.
