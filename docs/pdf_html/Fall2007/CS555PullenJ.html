</p><p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</p><p><b>The course will present techniques and systems for communication of data
between computational devices and the layers of the Internet Protocol Suite.
Topics include the role of various media and software components, local and wide
area network protocols, network design, performance and cost considerations, and
emerging advanced commercial technologies. Emphasis is on the TCP/IP family of
protocols. The ISO 7-layer reference model to organize the study. Students will
program simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project.</b>
</p><p><b>Prerequisites: STAT344 or equivalent; ability to program in
C/C++ or Java. Students will be required to confirm in writing that they meet the
prerequisites.</b>
</p><p><b>Project: We will use the Network Workbench (NW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the NW environment. NW will be available via IT&amp;E computing labs in
ST2 and by dial-in. A version that runs under Borland C++
Builder (version 5) and Microsoft Visual C++ (version 6) also is available. Well
documented code must be submitted by email to the TA for grading via an upload
webpage at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/course-upload">http://netlab.gmu.edu/course-upload</a>.
Additional projects are available for extra credit. The CS555  TA is
Muhammad Abdulla, email mabdull2@gmu.edu, office hours 17:00-19:00 Monday and 10:00-12:00 Thursday in 437 ST2.
The TA also is available by appointment at other times (send
email at least 24 hours in advance to set up appointment). Student problems with
the project are to be addressed to the TA; if he cannot resolve your problem,
he will pass it on to the author of NW who will deal with it.</b>
</p><p><b>The project is documented in one of the required texts. Copies of class
slides, software and documentation for the project are included with this text
on CDROM. Additional project information will be found at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/NW">http://netlab.gmu.edu/NW</a>.</b>
</p><p>
<b>New project software, the Java Network Workbench (JNW), will be introduced this semester
on a voluntary basis. Send email to mpullen@gmu.edu if you want to participate.</b>
</p><p><b>Students are responsible for assigned readings and all material outlined
in lecture slides.</b> <br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>GRADING POLICY</b>
</p><p><b>Homework 10%, Midterm exam 25%, Project 30%, Final exam 35%.</b>
</p><p><b>Project credit breakout: DLC2, DLC3, LAN1, WAN2, TRN1 and INT3 five
points each; extra credit up to four of DLC1, LAN2, WAN3, WAN4, INT1, and INT2 two points each.</b>
</p><p><b>Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam
date.</b>
</p><p><b>Assignments are due by 19:30 on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit. No project submission will be accepted after the reading day.</b>
</p><p><b>All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and elaborated for Computer Science. Students should be aware that their
submissions may be checked by plagiarism detection software.</b>
</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (but not higher than) A&nbsp; 93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B- 80; C 70.</b>
</p><p><b>Extra credit is available by doing extra projects; however, no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.</b> <br>&nbsp;
