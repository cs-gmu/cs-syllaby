<p><b>Course Prerequisites:   CS 105; Completion of at least 60 credit hours;  
Concurrent enrollment or completion of all other general education requirements.</b> 
</p>
  <b></b> 
<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students become 
effective professionals in the field of computer science by examining many 
of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer technology 
and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those challenges.  
Students will examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making 
and how to apply them to issues raised by computers and technology.  Specific 
topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns and software 
liability issues, will be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner.  
Emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and 
e-commerce will also be addressed. </p>
   
<p>Students will investigate the role of ethics for the computer professional 
in various situations through individual and group work. Students should be
prepared to participate during class activities and to interact with their 
classmates. Students will refine their personal points of view on various 
ethical issues and consider how such issues - and their own views - impact 
on professional colleagues, clients and the general public. </p>
