ed. Prentice Hall, 1988.

<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>
This is a new course, so the exact contents will evolve through the
semester.  The prerequisite is C or better in CS 112.  I will assume
that you have a basic understanding of the elements of programming in
some language derived from C (for example Java or C++).  The course
will be taught using C with possible excursions into Java or C++ later
in the semester.  This is a terminal course in programming for
engineers and we will look at some aspects of C and C-derived
languages and programming issues with which engineers should be
familiar.
</p>

<p>
Topics include the C language, elementary data structures, numerical
programming, and concepts of object-oriented design and programming.
</p>

<h3>Programs</h3>

<p>
There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website</p>

<p>
 You may discuss the programming projects with other students (this is
encouraged) but you must do and submit your own work.
<i>No joint work will be accepted.</i> Read the CS Department honor
code: <a
href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies"
name="[http://cs.gmu.edu/studtents/honor-code.html]">http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>,
and the University honor code: <a
href="http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html"
name="[http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html]">http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acad
pol.html</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.</p>

<p>
You will submit programs electronically and
you will also hand in a hard copy of your source code.  External
documentation will be handed in with the hard copy of your program.
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10 points per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work ("my disk crashed"
and "my roommate deleted my program" are <i>not</i>
reasons for late submissions).
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances (as judged by 
me), and any such makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</p>


<ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1"><li>programs: 35%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 35%</li>
</ul>
