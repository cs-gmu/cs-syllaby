     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>General Description and Preliminary List of Topics</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br>
        Pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic finding of regularities in data and with the use of these regularities to take actions, such as classifying images or documents into different categories.
        The course covers key algorithms and theory at the core of pattern recognition.
        Particular emphasis will be given to the statistical learning aspects of the field.
        Topics include:
        decision theory, Bayesian theory, curse of dimensionality, linear and non-linear 
        dimensionality reduction techniques, 
        classification, clustering,  
        kernel methods, mixture models and EM, HMMs, ensemble methods.

</ul>

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Format</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br> 
     Lectures by the instructor. Besides material from the textbook, topics not discussed in the book may also be
     covered.
     Research papers and handouts of material not covered in the book will
     be made available. 
     Grading will be based on homework assignments, 
     exams, and a project. Homework assignments will require 
     some programming. Exams and homework assignments must be done on an individual basis. Any deviation from this policy will be considered a violation of the <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">
            GMU Honor Code</a>. <br><br>

     <FONT SIZE=+1><b>Course Project</b></FONT SIZE=+1>: <br>
The project gives students an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic/area of the course. The topic of the project, of course, should be related to the material covered in class, but otherwise students are free to select the specific topic. Possible types of projects include:
   <blockquote>
     <li>
     <b>An application research project</b>: The project demonstrates the application of some techniques discussed in class in an application domain (e.g., text mining, bioinformatics, computer vision, image processing,  artificial intelligence etc.). Properties, drawbacks, advantages of the used techniques are analyzed within the context of the explored application domain.     
     </li>
 
     <li>
     <b>A theoretical or methodological research project</b>: A study of different classes of models and approaches; proving either theoretically or experimentally properties of known algorithms; designing a new approach. 
     </li>
