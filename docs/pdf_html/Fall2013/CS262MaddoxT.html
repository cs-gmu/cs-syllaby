   2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 1988         
<hr><b>Class Description:</b> &nbsp;Most high-level programming languages
 (and   particularly Java) insulate the programmer from the realities of
the  hardware   on which the programs will run. C is the exception since
it was  originally   designed to implement the Unix operating system. C offers
the  programmer  direct access to much of the underlying hardware and, for
programs  running  under Unix, direct access to operating system services.
For these  reasons  C remains the language of choice for systems programming.
<br>
   
<p><i><b>Prerequisite:</b> C or better in CS 211 or CS 222.</i> </p>
     
<hr><big><b>Course Topics:</b></big> &nbsp;This is a (short) course on "low-level"
 programming using C. We will learn   C with heavy emphasis on pointer operations.
 <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><big style="font-weight: bold;">Planned schedule of topics</big> (may change without warning):

<ul><li>Week 1: Intro to C, Intro to Unix, form of a C program</li><li>Week 2: The C preprocessor, types</li><li>Week 3: Basic I/O; control structures</li><li>Week 4: Arrays and strings</li><li>Week 5: Functions and function prototypes, scope</li><li>Week 6: Midterm</li><li>Week 7: gdb, intro to pointers</li><li>Week 8: More pointers, dynamic memory allocation, structs</li><li>Week 9: Using multiple source files, make</li><li>Week 10: bitwise operations</li></ul><b><big>Course outcomes</big></b><big>:</big><br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to implement, test and debug a designed
 solution   to a problem in a low-level programming language, specifically
 the C programming   language. <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate a good understanding of C language 
constructs   such as pointers, dynamic memory management, and address arithmetic. 
<br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate a good understanding of C libraries
 for   input and output, and the interface between C programs and the UNIX
 operating   system. <br>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate an ability to use UNIX tools for program
   development and debugging. <br>
      <br>
      <big><b>Grading: </b></big>&nbsp;In addition to the labs and projects 
 there  will be a midterm exam and a final. There will be no makeups on exams 
 except  under exceptional circumstances (as judged by me), and any such makeup
 must  be arranged in advanced. Grades will be computed using a weighted average
  of these scores with the weights: <br>
           
<ul>
        <li>lab assignments: (20%)</li>
        <li>programming projects (30%)</li><li>class/lab quizzes (10%)</li>
        <li>midterm exam (15%)</li>
               <li>final exam (25%)<br>
        </li>
           
</ul>
      <b>Labs:</b> &nbsp;A short programming assignment will be given at
the   beginning  of each lab. &nbsp;The lab instructor and one or more UTAs
will   be available  to help students with the assignment. If not completed,
the   lab may be taken  home. Lab assignments will be due either at the designated
  time for submission  on Blackboard or (if no submission is given on Blackboard)
  at the <b>beginning</b>  of the following lab period. No late lab assignments 
will  be accepted. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Attendance:</b> Attendance at both class lectures and labs is required.
   &nbsp;Exams will stress material covered in class and lab sessions.<br>
 <br>
      <b>Projects:</b> &nbsp;In addition to the labs there will be several
 larger   programming projects. &nbsp;Programming assignments will be posted
 on Blackboard   as they are assigned and must be submitted on Blackboard
by the assigned  due date. &nbsp;If your program is incomplete, you may still
 submit it for  partial credit. &nbsp;However, your code must run without
obvious errors (even if all functionality is not present). &nbsp;Building
your programs in a modular fashion and debugging as you go are crucial concepts
in program development. &nbsp;Additionally, your TA relies on running your
program as part of your grade determination. &nbsp;Accordingly, any programming
assignment that is submitted but either does not compile or has major errors
when it is run will receive no more than 50% credit. &nbsp;<br>
           
<p><b>Late Work: </b>Late projects will be penalized 10% per day (incl. weekend
   days/holidays). You should recognize that this can cause major penalties
  for incomplete programs, so start work early! If your program isn't the
way  you'd like it to be when the deadline is near, submit it anyway for
partial  credit. <b>In fact, submit early and often! </b> The system permits
you to   retrieve and resubmit your assignment until the due date, so you
may resubmit  if you improve your program prior to the deadline. &nbsp; (Resubmissions
 after the deadline require approval of your TA, since s/he may already have
 graded your project. If you know that you wish to resubmit a new version
after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your TA no later
than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time submission.)
<b>No resubmissions may be made after a project has been graded.</b> </p>
      <b>Class Communications: &nbsp;</b>CS 262 will be using the Blackboard
  system  for most class communications. You are responsible for any notifications
  or information posted on Blackboard either by your instructor, your GTA
or   the class UTA(s), and you will need to check Blackboard regularly for
such  notices. Some information may be disseminated through Blackboard rather
than  in class. Individual communications with the professor/GTA/UTA may
be done   by email using your GMU email account. When you email, please be
sure to  include your name, the class number and the topic in the subject
header. (E.g.: Subject: Jim Jones / CS 262 / Project 2)        
<hr> <b> PROGRAMMING POLICIES</b>       
<p>(1) <b>No sharing or discussion of code</b>. Unless specifically stated
   otherwise, all assignments are individual projects, not group projects.
 Students  are expected to do their own work, not to share programs with
each  other,  nor copy programs from anyone else. This means you may not
discuss  program  design or strategize solutions with anyone except your
instructor  or a course  UTA or GTA.<b> </b>However, you may offer more limited
assistance  to your  fellow students regarding specific questions on their
programming  assignments  by responding to queries on Blackboard. Any sharing
of code or discussion  of programming projects, except within the parameters
of Blackboard,  constitutes  an honor code violation. Suspected honor code
violations are  taken very seriously,  and will be reported to the Honor
Committee. Read the&nbsp; <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">GMU Honor Code</a> and
 <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS
   Department Honor Code.</a> You are bound by these codes. </p>
             
<p>(2) <b>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</b><i>.</i>
   You may <u>not</u> incorporate code written by others, such as can be
found    on the Internet or any of the numerous CS books available. You may
freely    use any code provided as part of the project specifications, without
any   need for crediting the source. However, if you use code provided by
your  instructor (other than that given as part of the project specifications)
or from the course textbook, you must document what portion came from those
sources. </p>
             
<p>(3) <b>Blackboard</b>. We encourage the use of Blackboard to discuss assignments
   and assist one another with programming questions. You may ask questions
  or respond to queries on Blackboard regarding projects or other assignments,
   <b>so long as you do not post any C code or detailed pseudocode, and so
 long  as you do not provide specific solutions to the overall problem or
algorithm  design (even in English)</b>. Often, students believe that "simple"
code is acceptable to place on Blackboard. However, because there is a wide
variation  in what different students and instructors regard as "simple,"
we must be  very strict about the ban against Blackboard code. <b>Only</b>
an instructor,  GTA or UTA is permitted to place code on blackboard unless
it is code that  has already been provided to all students (either as part
of the assignment  specification itself or within the class textbook). </p>
             
<p>(4) <b>Discussing Blackboard postings outside of Blackboard</b>. Please
   note that <u>Blackboard assistance must remain on Blackboard</u>. "Summarizing"
   Blackboard statements or responses to another student verbally regarding
  an assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject to the above ban on discussing
   assignment solutions. While it may seem harmless, Blackboard was set up
 so  that all assistance could be overseen by instructors/TAs/UTAs, and it
 is nearly impossible to truly duplicate Blackboard discussion outside of
Blackboard,  thus creating the potential for either (unknowing) mistaken
advice, or for unfair advantage by certain students. If you truly wish to
assist a fellow student, encourage him or her to log onto Blackboard, and
direct him/her to specific postings you find helpful. </p>
             
<p>(5) <b>Back up your program regularly.</b> You are expected to back up
 your program in separate files as you get different pieces working. Failure
 to do this may result in your getting a much lower grade on a program if
last minute problems occur. (Accidently deleting your program, having problems
   connecting, etc., will <u>not</u> be accepted as excuses.) </p>
             
<p>(6) <b>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</b>. It is
   important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final 
  submission. If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit 
  will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not changed 
  after being submitted. </p>
             
<p>(7) <b>Code must run on either Zeus or Mason gcc</b>. Students may develop
   programs using any computer system they have available. Please note, however,
   that submitted projects must run under a C compiler available either on
 Zeus  or Mason. Your documentation should clearly state which software was
 used  for compilation, and once makefiles are introduced, a makefile should
 be included with each assignment submission. <u>No extensions</u> will be
 given  due to compiler incompatibilities.<br>
