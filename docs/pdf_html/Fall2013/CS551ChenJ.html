<h3><a name=DESC id="DESC"></a>DESCRIPTION:</h3>



<ul>



  <li>CS 551 is a 3-credit graduate course. It gives an introduction to graphics 

    principles, advanced graphics methods, OpenGL graphics library, and programming. 

    The programming platform is Java or C. The course is taught in Java.</li>



  <li>I am assuming you know the prerequisite material, Java or C programming, 



    vector analysis, and matrix calculations. After this class, you will be able 



    to do graphics modeling and animation of certain objects or behaviors of your 



    preference.</li>



</ul>



<h3><a name=OUTCOME id="OUTCOME"></a>COURSE OUTCOMES:</h3>



<ul>



  <li> Apply trigonometry, geometry, vector analysis, and linear algebra to solve 



    real world problems. </li>



  <li>Analyze object positions and movements to define the computing methods and 



    solutions for multiple objects.</li>



  <li> Collaborate with classmates in teams in achieving the course project. </li>



  <li>Understand and use the current techniques, skills, and tools in GPU programming 



    for advanced lighting calculations.</li>



  <li> Understand advanced graphics capabilities such as texture mapping, ray-tracing, 



    pixel shading, bumped mapping, etc.</li>



</ul>

<h3><a name=GRADING id="GRADING"></a>GRADING POLICY:</h3>



<blockquote> 



  <p>There are all together 100 points:</p>



  <ul>



    <li> Homework assignments (20 points)</li>



    <li> In-class quizzes and exercises (20 points)</li>



    <li> One programming project (20 points)</li>



    <li> A Final Exam (40 points)</li>



  </ul>



  <p>Your overall course score, S, will be the sum of these points.</p>



  <ul>



    <li> A: S is at least 90 points</li>



    <li> B: S is at least 75 points</li>



    <li> C: S is at least 55 points</li>



    <li> F: S is fewer than 55 points</li>



  </ul>



  <p>Each assignment/project late may not be accepted. Therefore, you should plan 



    on working early. If there is an accident or emergency and you let me know, 



    I will consider it accordingly.</p>

<h3><a name=HONORCODE id="HONORCODE"></a>HONOR CODE:</h3>



<blockquote> 



  <p><a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">GMU Honor Code</a> 



    will be enforced. You are supposed to do your own programmings, assignments, 



    and projects. Violations of GMU Honor Code will result in an F. You may form 



    into study groups, most of size 3. You can meet with your study group and 



    discuss all homework questions and projects freely and frequently in your 



    group. However, you must do your own programmings, assignments, and projects.</p>



  <p>Disability Statement: If you have a learning or physical difference that 



    may affect your academic work, you will need to furnish appropriate documentation 



    to GMU Disability Resource Center. If you qualify for accommodation, the DRC 



    staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations for your instructor. 



    If you have such a condition, you must talk to the instructor during the first 



    week of the term about the issue.</p>

<h3><a name=SYLL id="SYLL"></a>SYLLABUS: (tentative)</h3>



<blockquote>



  <p> Will mostly follow the notes posted accompanying the text book with additions/modifications: 



  </p>



  <ul>



    <li><a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Ejchen/graphics/jogl/notes">http://cs.gmu.edu/~jchen/graphics/jogl/notes</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;This course is delivered to the Internet section online using the<br />
Moodle learning management system with MIST/C. Students in all<br />
sections will have accounts on Moodle and download the slide files<br />
from the Moodle course page. All enrolled students will be able to<br />
play recordings of class sessions; however, only students in online<br />
sections will be able to connect to live class sessions. Login<br />
information will be sent to all enrolled students by email,<br />
before the first scheduled class.&quot;</p>
