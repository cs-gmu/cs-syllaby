<h2 style="padding-top: 0em;">1 Course Basics</h2>

<h3> 1.1 Course Outcomes</h3>

<ul>
<li>An ability to use procedural programming language concepts
   including expressions, decision statements, simple data types,
   Boolean logic, input/output, loop constructs, and procedures.
</li>
<li>An ability to combine programming techniques to solve problems of
   varying degrees of difficulty.
</li>
<li>An ability to refine computer programs through testing and
   debugging to ensure proper operation.
</li>
<li>An ability to find and understand programming language
   documentation to learn new information needed to solve programming
   problems.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Prerequisites</h3>

<p>C or better in MATH 104, 105, or 113 (or sufficient score on the math
placement test).  

<p><b>Important Note about CS 101</b>.  CS 101 is a requirement for all CS/ACS majors, but not for non-majors.  CS/ACS Majors are expected
to take CS 101 with their first CS class, typically CS 112.  Thus if you are taking 112 this semester and are a CS or ACS major, you are
very strongly encouraged to enroll in CS 101.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Text</h3>

<p><i>The Practice of Computing Using Python</i>, Second Edition. William Punch and Richard Enbody.

<P>An <a href="http://www.coursesmart.com/IR/4701758/9780132805629?__hdv=6.8">eText</a> version is available.
<p>Readings will be suggested, but there will not be required problems from the book.
<p>An older version of the text uses Python 2.7.x, instead of Python
     3.x. There are a few significant differences in syntax, but if
     you can keep track of these (and different page numbers), you
     might be able to use an old version of the book if you've already
     got access to it.

<h3>2.1 Contacting Us</h3>

<p>All correspondence will go through Piazza. You can send private
messages to the instructors (professor, GTAs, UTAs all) as well as
post public questions visible to all students, collaborate on
responses, and tag everything by topic.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Course Materials</h3>

<P>All assignments will be submitted (per published deadlines) via
   Blackboard. This is basically the only use for Blackboard in the
   course. (submitting work, viewing grades).

<p>Course discussions will take place on Piazza. <a href="http://www.piazza.com/gmu/fall2013/cs112">Go sign up now</a>, so
   you don't miss announcements.

<P>Documents such as GTA/UTA contacts, schedules, and lecture slides
   will be on piazza.



<h2>3 Grading</h2>


<p>
The course will have a midterm and a final. Much of the work during
the semester will be completing projects, as well as regular
assessments in lab (quizzes and programming tasks).
</p>
<p>
In general, all work should be available about one week after turning
it in.
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<tr><th >Category</th><th scope="col" class="right">Percent Final Grade</th></tr>

<tr><td >Midterm</td><td class="right">15%</td></tr>
<tr><td >Final Exam</td><td class="right">25%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h3>3.1 Projects</h3>

<p>All project grades will be averaged together. Projects are due at a
specific time on a specific day. Each 24-hour period that is entered
before turning in the assignment will incur a 25% &ldquo;ceiling
penalty&rdquo;. This means your score will be the minimum between what
functionality score you achieve on it and the penalties score. For
instance, turning in an assignment 25 hours late is two &ldquo;days&rdquo; late,
so the lateness penalty score would be 100-25-25 = 50%. If you scored
a 93% for functionality, you would actually receive min(93,50)=50%. If
you scored only a 43% for functionality, your score would be
min(43,50)=43%. This is much better than a flat percentage penalty
off&mdash;the missed points overlap with the penalty!
</p>
<p>
Each student will be given <b>three Late-Day tokens</b> to skip the late
assignment penalty. They are automatically applied to the earliest
late submissions. 
</p>
<p>
The last project might not be allowed to be turned in late at all, to
facilitate grading by the deadline. If this is the case, leftover
late-day tokens will be worth a small reward.
</p>
<p>
<b>The lowest project grade will be dropped.</b>
</p>
<p>
After the first two projects, any code turned in that does not compile
(specifically on Python 3) will receive at most 50%. No exceptions. At
this point, if the grader is able to quickly fix your code, you might
get some points back. If the grader cannot immediately spot and fix
the issue, you'll be fortunate to get any points at all.
</p>

<p><b>Turning in code that runs is a big deal!</b>



<h4>3.1.1 Turning it in on BlackBoard</h4>

<p>You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,
and only the last version will be graded. You can also download your
submitted attempts, and verify that you turned in a working copy.
</p>

<p>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero.

<p>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
   extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
   service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
   takes. 

<h3>3.2 Lab Assessments</h3>

<p>All lab assessment grades will be averaged together. Lab assessments
will be either paper-and-pencil quizzes or computer-based tasks.
</p>
<p>
Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the reason
why (travel, illness, work, traffic, etc.)
</p>
<p>
We will <b>drop the lowest two grades</b> from this category.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to miss some early on, and later on have to miss for
some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save them so you
can actually throw out a bad grade, and not just to hide some zeroes.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Midterm and Final Exam</h3>

<p>The midterm and final exam will focus on performing programming.  They will be entirely paper and pencil&mdash;no computers.  
All students must have their <b>GMU identification available on testing days.</b>

<p>If you miss the midterm, and a valid reason is verified with
   documentation (ER visit, traffic accident, violent illness), I may
   elect to allow the final exam to count 40% to give you a sort of
   do-over. This policy is not automatic, however.

<p>If you miss the final, there is very little I can do for
   you. <b>Don't miss the final!</b>

<P>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course with
   knowledge of the schedule (see below).

<p><b>You must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b> You also need to
   have a passing percentage grade, but failure on the final exam
   indicates a systemic lack of true progress. Generally, students who fail the final exam do not have a passing grade in the course anyways.

<p>There will only be a curve if a specific question ends up being too
   ambiguous or otherwise obviously unfair.

<h3>3.4 Calculating Semester Grades</h3>

<ul>
<li> Given the percentages above, the allowed assessment/project
   drops, you should always be able to calculate your semester grade
   at any point in the semester.
</li>
<li> There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the end
   of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
   semester-long progress.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Grades will be assessed on the following scale:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<thead>
<tr><th >Grade</th><th >Cut-off Score</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td >A+</td><td >98 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >A</td><td >92 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >A-</td><td >90 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >B+</td><td >88 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >B</td><td >82 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >B-</td><td >80 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >C+</td><td >78 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >C</td><td >72 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >C-</td><td >70 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >D</td><td >60 %</td></tr>
<tr><td >F</td><td >&mdash;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h3>3.5 Contested Grades</h3>

<p>If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
grader. For all projects and lab assessments, that either your lab GTA or
someone who signed your grade comments.  For the midterm and final exam, that is your
professor.
</p>
<p>
If you have not initiated contact within a week of receiving the
grade, it is too late. We cannot entertain a swarm of contested grades
at the eleventh hour to try to maximize end-of-semester grades.
</p>
<p>
We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often
through specific tests, which might even be automated as part of the
grading process.
</p>

<h2>4 The Honor Code</h2>

<p>
The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of
your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must
ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</p>
<p>
I personally take the honor code very seriously. Any attempts at
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply
will not be tolerated.
</p>
<p>
As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from
a friend, remember that it is just as easy to compare your work
electronically, and discover the similarities. Repeat to
yourself: <b>it's not worth trying to cheat.</b> I will catch it, and sadly
but surely, I will turn it in.
</p>
<p>
The penalty for cheating will be far worse than a zero grade.
</p>


<h3> 4.1 Some Specifics and Links</h3>

<ul>
<li>All students will abide by <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/honor-code/">GMU's Honor Code</a>.
</li>
<li>All work must be your own.  If you are caught cheating, you and
    every other involved student will be turned in to the honor court.
</li>
<li>See the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS Honor Code Policies</a> to understand better what
    constitutes cheating in the CS setting.
</li>
<li>See the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/StatementOnAcademicIntegrity">CS Statement on Academic Integrity</a> for more information.
</li>
</ul>



<h2>5 Learning Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you must
(a) make sure this documentation is on file with <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu/">Office for Disability Services</a>
(SUB I, Rm. 4205; 993-2474;<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu/">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>)
and (b) speak with the professor ASAP to discuss your accommodation needs.
