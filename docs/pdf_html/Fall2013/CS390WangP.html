      <p><strong>Course Description:</strong>      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        CS 390 provides students with an introduction
        to the research and project design process as applied within the
        computing field.  Students will learn about the tools of the trade and
        work through design principles starting with the articulation of a
        question, reviewing methods
        of exploration, gathering evidence, communicating results,
        and assessing/evaluating research or project outcomes.
        
        <p>
        Students will be able to work individually and in small groups, and participate
        in a research or design experience. You will have the
        opportunity to design and evaluate projects involving
        the use of Kinects, iOS, and Android devices.
See the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~pwang/cs390/timetable.html">Lecture Timetable</a> 
        for the list of topics that will be covered in the class.
        </p>

        This course is for students who are interested in 
        getting involved in undergraduate research 
      <a href= "http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UropPage"> (see UROP) </a>
        or who plan to do a senior design project in the future (see

      <blockquote>
        CS 390 is an activity-based course.  This means that students
        must attend all classes and contribute to on-going
        discussions.  There are no exams, but the course grade will be based
        on class participation and completion of a semester project or research paper:

        <blockquote> 
        (1) Participation: readings critiques, progress reports, and presentations: 40%
         <p>
        (2) Semester project: 60%
        <blockquote> 
                30% - project design/research plan documents, including regular revisions<br><br>
                30% - final report containing documented software and/or project artifacts.  For a researh paper, final document should show evidence of an original contribution 
        </blockquote>
