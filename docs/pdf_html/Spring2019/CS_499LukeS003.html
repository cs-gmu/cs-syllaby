<p><h3 style="padding-top: 0.55em;">Professor</h3><a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke</a>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Thursdays, 4:30 to 7:10 PM, in Innovation Hall 215G.
 
 
<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>MATH 114, CS310, CS367, and some degree of music performance, synthesizer, or music production experience.

<p><h3>About the Class</h3>This course will introduce the student to scientific and engineering topics, computer algorithms, and software design issues involving the development of software
and hardware music synthesizers, controllers, MIDI devices, and sequencers.  The class 
is hands-on, involving real synthesis examples and software development.  Topics
covered will involve music synthesis history, acoustics and psychoacoustics of sound 
and music, digital representation of sound, several synthesis methods, controllers,
and artifical intelligence applications.  The class will include assignments and a final project.


<p><h3>Warning</h3> This course will probably be <b>very hard</b> but (I hope!) interesting and eye-opening. Developing a music synthesizer involves knowledge of a broad array of computer science fields, including real-time systems, signal processing, networks and serial protocols, and artificial intelligence; plus significant domain-specific knowledge from acoustics, music, and psychology. You are expected to know the material in MATH 114, CS310, and CS367 well, and be able to get up to speed rapidly doing software development in nontrivial projects.  You should also be prepared to draw ideas from multiple areas outside of computer science.

<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be divided roughly as follows:

<span class="list">20%</span> Midterm,
 
<span class="list">20%</span> Non-cumulative Final Exam,
 
<span class="list">60%</span> Assignments and final Project.

 
<P><h3>Honor Code</h3> The class enforces the <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science. You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.
 
<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.
