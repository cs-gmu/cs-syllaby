<h1>Computer Science 880 / 001</h1> 
 
<h2>Advanced Metaheuristics<span class="subhead"><br>
(Research Topics in Artificial Intelligence)</span></h2>
 
 
 
<p><h3>Meets</h3> Thursday, 4:30 PM to 7:10 PM, in Room L008 of the Art and Design Building.
 
 
<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/">Sean Luke.</a> 
 
<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3> <b>Permission of the instructor.</b>  Ideally you will have previous experience in the topic, or have taken a course covering elementary metaheuristics, evolutionary computation, etc.  Some recent courses in thic category include: <span class="list">CS795</span> (Evolutionary Computation)<span class="list">CS695</span> (Metaheuristics)<span class="list">CS687</span> (Advanced AI)<span class="list">CS/IT803</span> (Evolutionary Computation) <span class="list">CS/IT910</span> (Natural Computation).
</span>
  
 
<p><h3>About the Class</h3> This course will cover select advanced topics in metaheuristics, a branch of stochastic optimization which includes evolutionary computation, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing, among others.  The course will be project-rich, involve significant readings, and will directly involve access to large cluster machines.    A small portion of the course will cover review of basic algorithms; then the course will turn to various advanced algorithms; and cumulate in student projects and presentations.

<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be largely based on intermediate and final projects.
  
<P><h3>Honor Code</h3> The class enforces the <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and to the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science. You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.
 
<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.
