Course Description
</h3>

This course is a hands-on in-depth introduction to the structure of the
Unix operating system with emphasis to the system libraries using ANSI
C. It is appropriate for students who want to learn the principles of
how to design and implement system applications. The course begins with
an introduction of the C programming language and continues with the
basic Unix Operating System data structures and Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs). Using hands-on laboratory exercises students will be
exposed to the concepts of inter-process communications, synchronization,
and process and thread management with emphasis on security applications.

<h3><img src="http://cs.gmu.edu/~mabdulla/images/ball-bullet.gif" alt="Bullet" height="15" width="30">Policies</h3>

    The point of this course is your intellectual enlightenment and enjoyment.
 I want the course to run as smoothly as possible, so I encourage feedback
 on both positive and negative aspects. Feel free to drop by my office,
 send email, or leave a note. Note that the Instructor reserves the right
 to modify the schedule and topics as needed.

     <br>

     <br>
     <a name="programs"></a>
     <b>Programs</b>
     <br>
     <br>
     Programs must be turned in to the TA, and are due before class on the day of their due dates. Please do not skip class to finish your program! 

     <br>
     <br>
     <a name="grading"></a>

     <b>Grading</b>
     <br>
     <br> 
 Student <b>grade</b> is split according to the following schedule:
  <ul> 
    <li> 40% homeworks</li> 
    <li> 40% mini-project</li> 
    <li> 15% final exam </li> 
    <li> 5%  class participation </li> 
  </ul> 

 Student <b>letter grade</b> is determined as follows:<br><br>

  <table border="1"> 
    <tbody><tr><th align="center">Letter Grade</th><th> Grade</th></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">A+</td><td> [97,100]</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">A&nbsp;</td><td> [93,97)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">A-</td><td> [88,93)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">B+</td><td> [84,88)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">B&nbsp;</td><td> [80,84)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">B-</td><td> [75,80)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">C&nbsp;</td><td> [65,73)</td></tr> 
    <tr><td align="center">F&nbsp;</td><td> [0,65)</td></tr> 
  </tbody></table> 

<br>

 When your work is returned to you, check it. If you disagree about a
 particular solution, please document in writing what you think the
 grading mistake is. Please do not make immediate verbal complaints to
 the professor or TA.

 <br> 
 <br> 
 <b>Class participation</b> counts toward your grade. I expect and
    encourage thoughtful and lively participation and discussion.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 I typically DO NOT <b>scale</b> or <b>curve</b> grades unless there is
 a classwide epidemic of failure. Plan your work and effort based on the
 assumption that there will be no curve.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 You can <b>contact me</b> via email, but please start your email's subject 
 with the string <code>[ISA563]</code>; it helps me filter my email. Short
 (one or two paragraphs) emails are appreciated.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 While <b>collaboration</b> on homework and projects is greatly
 encouraged, your answers must be original. No collaboration is
 allowed on the final exam. Students collaborating on
 assignments must clearly list with whom they worked.  The bottom line
 is that general discussion is welcome, but specific solutions cross
 the line.
     <br>

     <br> 
     <a name="honor"></a>
     <b>Honor Code</b>
     <br>
 <br> 
 <b>Cheating and Plagiarism</b> are absolutely forbidden.  I assume
 that you have read <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">GMU Honor Code</a>.  Please refer
 to the links at the top of this page. It is almost absurdly easy to
 discover cheating.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <b>Late</b> work is generally not accepted. Late submission loses 10%
 of the assignment's value per day.
