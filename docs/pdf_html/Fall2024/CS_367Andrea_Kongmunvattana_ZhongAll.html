      <li>1% extra credit rewarded for every 24 hours your submission made before the due time for the Coding Projects.</li>
      <li>Up to 5% extra credit will be rewarded towards your project grade.</li>
      <li>Your latest submission before the due time will be used for grading and extra credit.</li>

    <li><b>Late Tokens:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone starts with 3 Late Tokens total for all Projects during the Semester.</li>
      <li>Each Late Token adds 24 hours to the Deadline of a Project.</li>
      <li>Late Tokens are <b>Automatically Used</b> when you submit Late.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You don't need to tell your GTA, they will deduct Late Tokens based on Submission Time.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>You may only use up to 2 of your total Late Tokens for a single Project.</b></li>
      <li>Unused Tokens have no Grade Value at the end of the semester.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Late Work (No Tokens Remaining):</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>You may only submit up to 48 hours after the Official Deadline of the Project.</li>
      <li>If you run out of Late Tokens, each additional day late will have a grade penalty.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For every late day without a token, a 25% Ceiling Pentalty will be Applied</li>
        <ul>
          <li>So, for one day late without a token, your max possible score will be a 75%.</li>
          <li>And for two days late without tokens, your max possible score will be a 50%.</li>
        </ul>

<div id="zeus" class="main">
  <h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>Systems Programming</b> class.  Unlike CS 262 or CS 
222, which are general-purpose C courses for any computer system, this 
course is based on building programs for a specific system.  For CS 367,
 that system is Zeus. </p>

  <p>Zeus is a Linux computer running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is 
administerd by the College of Engineering and Computing for our use.  
Some of our programs will involve libraries that have been pre-built on 
Zeus, and some programs will use system specific features that may only 
build properly on Zeus.</p>

  <h3>Zeus Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>All Projects must Compile and Run on Zeus</b> </li>
    <li> All Projects will be Tested and Graded only on Zeus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> You may develop wherever and using whichever tools you like. </li>
      <li> You will need to ensure your work builds and runs on Zeus before submission. </li>
      <li> A project that will not compile on Zeus cannot be graded. </li>
      <li> Remember, C has certain guarantees and others that are only 
'system dependent'. It still needs to run properly on Zeus to be graded.
 </li>
    </ul>
    <li> You will need to set up the Campus VPN to access Zeus from off-campus. </li>

<!--[HONOR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id="honor" class="main">
  <h2>Academic Standards (Honor Code)</h2>

  <p>Academic Standards exist to promote authentic scholarship, support 
the institution’s goal of maintaining high standards of academic 
excellence, and encourage continued ethical behavior of faculty and 
students to cultivate an educational community which values integrity 
and produces graduates who carry this commitment forward into 
professional practice.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As members of the George Mason University community, we are 
committed to fostering an environment of trust, respect, and scholarly 
excellence. Our academic standards are the foundation of this 
commitment, guiding our behavior and interactions within this academic 
community. The practices for implementing these standards adapt to 
modern practices, disciplinary contexts, and technological advancements.
 Our standards are embodied in our courses, policies, and scholarship, 
and are upheld in the following principles:&nbsp;</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Honesty:&nbsp;</strong>Providing accurate information in all academic endeavors, including communications, assignments, and examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  
    <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong>&nbsp;Giving proper credit for 
all contributions to one’s work. This involves the use of accurate 
citations and references for any ideas, words, or materials created by 
others in the style appropriate to the discipline. It also includes 
acknowledging shared authorship in group projects, co-authored pieces, 
and project reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Uniqueness of Work:</strong>&nbsp;Ensuring that all 
submitted work is the result of one’s own effort and is original, 
including free from self-plagiarism. This principle extends to written 
assignments, code, presentations, exams, and all other forms of academic
 work.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Violations of these standards—including but not limited to 
plagiarism, fabrication, and cheating—are taken seriously and will be 
addressed in accordance with university policies. The process for 
reporting, investigating, and adjudicating violations is <a href="https://academicstandards.gmu.edu/">outlined in the university’s procedures</a>.
 Consequences of violations may include academic sanctions, disciplinary
 actions, and other measures necessary to uphold the integrity of our 
academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The principles outlined in these academic standards reflect our 
collective commitment to upholding the highest standards of honesty, 
acknowledgement, and uniqueness of work. By adhering to these 
principles, we ensure the continued excellence and integrity of George 
Mason University’s academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Student responsibility:&nbsp;</strong>Students are 
responsible for understanding how these general expectations regarding 
academic standards apply to each course, assignment, or exam they 
participate in; students should ask their instructor for clarification 
on any aspect that is not clear to them<em>.</em></p>

  <p>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or 
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply 
will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work 
from a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to 
compare your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use 
automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by 
hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Academic Standards 
Office. Repeat to yourself: it's not worth trying to cheat. We will 
catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.</p>

  <p><b>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The usual Sanction applied is Level 2 (Failure in the course).</b></li>
    <li>It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a semester and lose some 
implicated friends; please don't put yourself through that experience!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><b>Course Policies</b></h3>
  <ul>
      <li><b>You are not allowed to use code from the Internet.</b></li>

  <h2>Sexual Harassment and Interpersonal Violence Policies</h2>

  <p>As a part of George Mason University’s commitment to providing a 
safe and non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment 
for all members of the University community, the University does not 
discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or 
employment programs and activities. Accordingly,&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;non-
confidential employees, including your faculty member, have a legal 
requirement to report to the Title IX Coordinator, all relevant details 
obtained directly or indirectly about any incident of Prohibited Conduct</strong>&nbsp;
(such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, gender-based stalking, 
dating/domestic violence). Upon notifying the Title IX Coordinator of 
possible Prohibited Conduct, the Title IX Coordinator will assess the 
report and determine if outreach is required. If outreach is required, 
the individual the report is about (the “Complainant”) will receive a 
communication, likely in the form of an email, offering that person the 
option to meet with a representative of the Title IX office.</p>

  <p>For more information about non-confidential employees, resources, and Prohibited Conduct, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/sexual-harassment-policy/">University Policy 1202</a>:
 Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct and Other Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence. Questions regarding Title IX can be directed to the Title IX 
Coordinator via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:TitleIX@gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TitleIX@gmu.edu</a>, by phone at 703-993-8730, or in person on the Fairfax campus in Aquia 373.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
