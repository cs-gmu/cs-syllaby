<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Grading Policy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The grade will be determined by grades obtained in assignments (avg),
quizzes (avg), and test scores. If circumstances require it
(e.g. weather, delays in course progress), the grading scale may be
adjusted at the instructor's discretion, generally in the students'
favor. If any extra credit is available, it will tend to be available
on specific assignments, and not as an end-of-semester batch of extra
work. If you're not happy with the trajectory of your grade, change
something!
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> - life events, both positive and negative, have a way of
affecting students' ability to complete the occasional assignment on
time or at all; at those moments, it's appropriate that academics
might need to be secondary to other facets of a student's life. This
is the reason we are dropping one assignment grade and one quiz
grade - whether this is for an illness, a funeral, attending a
conference, or whatever reason, these drops are to help students keep
up their grades despite this, regardless of whether they are willing
to speak up about the situation or not. If there is any longer term
issue prohibiting a student from completing assignments, that should
by then be something that the Office of Disability Services would be
able to handle - for example, if a student has a concussion or a
broken arm, they may suddenly need some temporary accommodations to
complete the semester succesfully. Thus if a student is going to miss
a deadline, we will lean on the drops policy to cover it and in
general further requests for extensions or exceptions are not likely
beyond accommodations that are established with ODS.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Late Work</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>No work is accepted later than 48 hours after the posted
deadline.</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>up to 24 hours late: max score allowed is 90%.
</li>
<li>up to 48 hours late: max score allowed is 75%.
</li>
<li>later than 48 hours: max score allowed is  0%.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>notice that those deadlines aren't subtracting 10% or 25%: they
just cap the maximum points possible. As an example, if you are
about halfway done with an assignment on time, as much progress
as you can make towards 90% one extra day will all be rewarded.
</li>
<li>being just a few minutes later than one of these cutoffs is
unfortunate, but the above timings will be applied. Remember, you
can turn in your work more than once and update your
efforts. Please don't play with deadline fire and end up
surprised/burned!
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Contested Grades</b>: All regrade requests are due within a week of
the grade becoming available on Canvas or GradeScope. To do so,
either fill out the regrade request on Gradescope, schedule a
meeting in person with the grader, or send an email requesting
further feedback and consideration. After that week, the window to
contest a grade has closed other than recording errors. Contact the
GTA about homework/projects, and contact the professor about tests.
</li>

<li><b>Assignments</b> - some are on paper and pencil, others are coding
exercises in various languages. All are weighted equally as
<i>percentages</i>: the lowest one is dropped, and the rest are averaged
for your assignments score. Each assignment will generally be the
active assignment for about one week or so.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Assignment deadlines: Our assignment deadlines will all generally
be during business hours, i.e. 8am-5pm, M-F deadlines. If I give
you a midnight deadline, that's asking you to stay up late
working, which isn't healthy or fair. You will always have at
least a full week when you can work on the assignment, so what
ever time is best for you to work on our assignments, you will
have that time on each assignment.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Quizzes</b> - some weeks we will have a quiz related to the most
recently completed assignment. Regardless of reason, we only drop
the one lowest grade; save it for the unplanned things. If you miss
multiple quizzes you will start having zeroes calculated in,
whether it was for traffic, illness, a cousin's wedding, a court
date, or attending a conference.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all quizzes will be announced ahead of time, through
force-emailed piazza announcements. Occasionally we might have a
quiz online instead of in class.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Tests</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Student ID is required for all in-person tests.
</li>
<li>If the midterm is missed, the final exam automatically counts
that much more. A higher final exam grade will replace a midterm grade.
</li>
<li>Missing the final exam is very hard to recover from - plan ahead!
If you are flying anywhere, don't purchase tickets that overlap
exams week. If we get enough bad weather days, our exam date
could likely change. See the <a href="https://registrar.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Spring-2023-Final-Exam-Schedule.pdf">GMU Final Exams Schedule</a> for
details.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Semester Calculuations</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There does not tend to be any curve at the end of the semester in
this course - I generally curve individual assignments if
necessary so that semester grades are on track to their final
destinations.
</li>
<li>When calculating letter grades for the end of the semester, while
I do a bit of rounding to make sure nobody falls into the
floating-point trap (90≠89.99999996), I don't round up more than
0.1. This means that if you have an 89.9, sure we can round that
up to an A-. But an 89.899 would not be rounded up. No matter
where we set the boundary, it's always possible to end up just
shy of the next level, and we have to set the line in the sand
somewhere. I suggest you treat all those earlier "easier"
assignments as the tie breaker for your semester grade and get
them completed, on time, so you have more breathing room at the
end of the semester.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Academic Standards (Honor Code)</b>: All graded work must be your
own. Any attempts at cheating will not be tolerated, and will be
turned in to the Honor Court with significant penalties likely -
including F in the course, attendance in an Academic Integrity
seminar, and more for second+ offenses. By enrolling in this
course, you should be familiar with these:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://academicstandards.gmu.edu/">the honor code at GMU</a> (updated Fall 2024 to "Academic Standards").
</li>
<li>further details of the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code Policies</a> (and some
<a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/honor-code-examples/">examples</a>), which help explain what the honor code means in a
computing/programming space
</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~marks/honor.txt">my own thoughts</a> on the honor code
In short you should never see, share, or discuss any part of the
solution to any graded work, from algorithm development to
implementation to debugging to personal test cases. Efforts to
obtain assignments from previous semesters is prohibited. Beware
situations where someone else can take your code from you, as it is
hard to prove later on. When in doubt, ask your instructor and GTA
instead of another student. For clarity, It's okay for this class
to study together on completed+graded works ahead of tests.
</li>
<li>note that incorporating responses from ChatGPT or similar
platforms into your submitted work violates the above
requirements, as it is not your work.

I value the many perspectives that all of you bring to our class. I
value each and every one of you. I want you to succeed, to feel

deserve. We are allowed to be unique individuals. Be patient and kind
with each other as we all work through another interesting semester in
each other's company. Assume the best of each other and our
intentions, and own up to the effects we have on others. I will do my
best to pay attention to how you have arrived at this course, meet you
where you are, and help you get the most out of our time together. If
you work harder, I will meet your efforts with you gladly. If you feel
lost or unsupported, I will help you when I can and help you find

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Learning Disabilities and Support</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I generally honor all accommodations formally established through
GMU's <a href="https://ds.gmu.edu/">Office of Disability Services</a>. This requires students to
self-advocate, and proactively request use of these accommodations
(such as requesting alternate testing times a <i>week</i> in advance), so
get things sorted out ahead of time in case you think it may be
necessary or useful. They also assist with short-term situations such
as concussions - if our late work and drops policy can't handle a
prolonged situation, then ODS is the right channel to establish what
kind of support is appropriate for you to get through the semester
successfully without needing a medical withdrawal. Below are how some
common accommodations work in this class.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>extended time on quizzes/tests:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>tests and finals can be taken at the ODS testing center to
facilitate the extra time. We need the testing sheet ahead of
time in order to successfully get you scheduled. I am okay with
time of day flexibility to meet the rest of your class schedule.
</li>
<li>quizzes: our quizzes are usually 10-15 minutes at the end of
class; many students choose to just sit for the quiz in class
and I can collect your paper later on. However, the testing
center is still a fine option here. The quizzes are announced so
you can still schedule a time at the testing center as desired.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>assignment extensions: note that you will need to request this
extension a full day before the deadline, and include your
progress so far as part of the request. It is also not good to
use this accommodation on every assignment, as each assignment
timeframe then eats into the next. We will always work on
getting back on track for the next assignments.
</li>
<li>audio recording of lectures: please complete the audio recording
agreement before any audio is recorded so that we can discuss the
parameters.
</li>
<li><i>note - all test center scheduling can be done as early as day one of the semester - students with accommodations are encouraged to complete these requests early on.</i>
