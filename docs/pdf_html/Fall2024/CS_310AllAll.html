      <p>For All Classes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> You will need a computer for this class with some modern operating
          system capable of running a Java compiler (for Java 1.9 or higher, the
          latest stable version of OpenJDK is preferred). Remember that lab
          computers are also available on campus, see campus resources below. </li>
        <li> The prerequisite for this course is C or better in CS 211. We will
          assume that you have developed a significant degree of skill in
          programming (program organization, coding, documenting, testing and
          debugging) -- you will develop yet more this semester. We will also
          assume that you are acquainted with basic complexity analysis ("big
          O") and are able to build abstract data types using Java classes. </li>
        <li> Be prepared to move online if the semester requires it for any
          reason (see online class requirements below). </li>

      <p>For Online and Hybrid Classes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> You will regularly use either Blackboard Collaborate
          (https://mymason.gmu.edu) or Zoom (https://zoom.us/) for your class
          meetings. </li>
        <li> You are required to have regular, reliable access to a computer
          with an updated operating system (recommended: Windows 10 or Mac OSX
          10.13 or higher) and a stable broadband Internet connection (cable

      <p> CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211. Students
        will learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming
        problems than the projects in CS 211. Programming is a significant part
        of this course and students should expect to spend a good deal of time
        on the programming projects. The course also introduces a variety of
        data structures and illustrates the types of problems for which they are
        useful. </p>
      <p> Tentative topics to be covered include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lists, Stacks, and Queues</li>
        <li>Hash Tables and Hashing</li>
        <li>Trees and Basic Tree Algorithms</li>
        <li>Graphs and Basic Graph Algorithms</li>

      <p> In CS310, students will: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Gain an ability to analyze the runtime efficiency of algorithms
          that create and manipulate data structures. </li>
        <li> Gain an ability to compare data structure trade-offs such that the
          student is able to choose appropriate implementations for a given data
          structure and appropriate data structures for a given application. </li>
        <li> Reinforce their knowledge of basic data structures (linked lists,
          dynamic array lists, stacks, and queues) and extend their knowledge to
          more sophisticated data structures, including hash tables, balanced
          trees, priority queues, and basic graphs. </li>
        <li> Implement and use learned data structures to solve real computing
          problems. This includes substantial reinforcement of language-specific
          techniques for abstract data types and design and debugging
          techniques. </li>

      <ul>
        <li> Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by
          instructor. They will be entirely paper and pencil - no computers. </li>
        <li> All tests and exams are considered <b>individual</b> efforts,
          therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of problem solutions
          are allowed with anyone except the TAs or the professor. Resources
          available during exams will be specified by the instructor on a
          exam-by-exam basis. </li>
        <li> All students must have their GMU identification available on
          testing days (and will be required to show a photo ID as part of the
          exam process). </li>
        <li> Unless specified, all exams are cumulative (including the final
          exam). </li>
        <li> Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances (as
          judged by the instructors) and must be arranged in advance. Vacation
          plans are not exceptional circumstances. </li>
        <li> If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused absence
          (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of the exam), you
          must notify your professor within 24 hours of your absence to make
          arrangements for a makeup, and bring approved documentation with you
          when you take the make-up exam. Failure to follow these policies will
          result in a zero. We may elect to replace a missed midterm with some
          (or all) of the final exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam
          under these circumstances. </li>
        <li> Missing an exam due for any non-university-accepted reason (such as
          not paying attention to when the exam is), will result in a zero. </li>
        <li> As written in the Assessments and Grades section: You must pass the
          final exam (60% or higher) OR have a <i>weighted</i> average exam
          score above passing (60% <i>weighted</i> average) to pass the class
          (receive a non-F grade). Example: You receive a 55% on the final exam,
          you will automatically receive an "F" in the course <i>unless</i> the
          result of this formula is true: <br>
          <span style="font-family:monospace,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((MIDTERM_WEIGHT*MIDTERM_SCORE)+(FINAL_WEIGHT*FINAL_SCORE))/(MIDTERM_WEIGHT+FINAL_WEIGHT)
            &gt;= 60</span><br>
          So for your scenario: <br>
          <span style="font-family:monospace,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((0.25*MIDTERM_SCORE)+(0.3*55))/(0.25+0.3)
            &gt;= 60</span><br>
          Meaning 66/100 on the midterm would be required to pass with a final
          exam score of 55%. </li>

        <li> Due to the size of the class, individual professors and graders
          cannot support students with injuries or disabilities on an ad-hoc

          through GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Office of
            Disability Services</a>. </li>

          ASAP to discuss their approved accommodations. Even if you don't know
          whether you plan on utilizing the accommodations for any
          assignment/test, you need to make sure you and your professor are
          working together from the beginning of the semester to ensure your

          soon as possible. Even if you don't know whether you'll need to
          utilize the accommodations, it's in your best interest to prepare
          ahead of time and get your condition documented as accommodations are
          not retroactive. They have a quick and easy registration process. All
