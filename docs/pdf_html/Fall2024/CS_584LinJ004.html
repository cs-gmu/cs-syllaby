  <dt> <b>Course Description</b> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Concepts and techniques in data mining and multidisciplinary
  applications. Topics include data cleaning and transformation;
  classification and predictive modeling; clustering; association
  analysis; performance analysis and scalability; data mining in
  advanced database systems, including text, audio, and images; and emerging themes and future
  challenges. Students will gain hands-on experience and learn how to
  implement and apply various data mining algorithms.<br>

<ul>

  <li>Formally: Grade of C
or better in CS 310 (Data Structures) and STAT 344 (Probability and
Statistics) or equivalent.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>More specifically: Programming experience in Python, or willing
  to learn. Experience in Java or C++ will work as well, but the assignments will
  use the Python framework. Students should be familiar with basic probability and
statistics concepts, and linear algebra. Please expect lots of
programming in the assignments.</li>

  <dt> <b>Assignments</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be 4-5 competition-style programming assignments in
  Python. Competition winners will get 1%
  extra credit added to the final grade. You are allowed 3 days of
  grace period past the deadline, with 10% penalty each day. You will
  receive 0 credit if the homework is not submitted by then. Note that
  internet trouble is not a valid excuse for subbmitting
  late. Therefore, you should plan to submit a few hours early to
  avoid last minute technical difficulties.</p>
    <p> </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Exams</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>All exams in the class are closed-book, and they must be taken
  at the scheduled time, unless prior arrangement has been made with
    the instructor. Missed exams cannot be made up.</p>

   <p>There will be 5 quizzes throughout the semester. The purpose of the quizzes is to
  help you stay on track of the lecture materials and assigned readings, so they are
  typically short (20 minutes) and easier compared to the final
  exam. The quiz schedule will be announced in advance. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</p>

    <p>The final exam is comprehensive. While it's closed book, you
  are allowed to bring one letter-size, single-sided cheat sheet to
  the final exam.</p>

  <dt><b>Class Participation/Activities</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be able to earn credit through various in-class or out-of-class
  activities.

<!--  <dt> <b>Project</b></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>There will be one team project in the semester. The project
grade
consists of project proposal (including project pitch, 5% total of
overall course grade), video presentation (5%), and project report and code
(20%).<br>

      <p>The <a href="https://academicstandards.gmu.edu/academic-standards-code/">GMU
Academic Standards Code</a> is in effect at all times. In addition, the CS
Department has further honor code policies regarding programming
projects, which are detailed <a
      href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">here</a>. Some
      examples can be found <a
      href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/honor-code-examples/">here</a>. Any
      deviation from the GMU Academic Standards or the CS department Honor Code is
considered a violation. All assignments for this class are <u><b>individual</b></u>
unless otherwise specified. ChatGPT or other Generative-AI models may
      NOT be used in this course as an assistant in the assignments. </p>

    <dd>
      <p>If you have a documented learning disability or other
condition
which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is
on file with the Office of Disability Services and then discuss with
the professor about accommodations.</p>
