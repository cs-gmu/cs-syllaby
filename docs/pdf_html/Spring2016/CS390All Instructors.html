	<h1>CS 390: Research and Project Design Principles in Computing</h1>	
	<h2>(Spring 2016)</h2>
	
	<h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>
	<p>CS 390 provides students with an introduction to the research and project design process as applied within the computing field. Students will learn about the tools of the trade and work through design principles starting with the articulation of a question, reviewing methods of exploration, gathering evidence, communicating results, and assessing/evaluating research or project outcomes.</p>
	<p>This course will be of interest to the following students:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Students interested in a two semester capstone experience should enroll in this course followed by CS 490 - Design Exhibition.</li>
		<li>Students who would like to get involved in undergraduate research (see <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UropPage">UROP</a>).</li>
		<li>Students interested in working on realworld problems with area companies. Several local companies have proposed projects and will have mentors available throughout the semester.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
	<p>CS 262 (Low level Programming) is required</p>
	<p>CS 310 (Data Structures) and CS 321 (Software Requirements & Design Modeling) is highly recommended</p>

	<h3>COURSE REQUIREMENTS &amp; GRADING</h3>
	<p>CS 390 is an activity-based course. This means that students must attend all classes and contribute to on-going discussions. There are no exams, but the course grade will be based on class participation and completion of a semester project or research paper:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Participation: readings critiques, progress reports, and presentations: 40%</li>
		<li>
			Semester project: 60%
			<ul>
				<li>30% - project design/research plan documents, including regular progress reports and revisions.</li>
				<li>30% - final report containing documented software and/or project artifacts. For a research paper, final document should show evidence of an original contribution.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
