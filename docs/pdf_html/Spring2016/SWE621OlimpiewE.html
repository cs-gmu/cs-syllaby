<p><strong>Course Description</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a course in concepts and methods for the architectural design of software systems of sufficient size and complexity to require the effort of several people for many months. Fundamental design concepts and design notations are introduced. Several design methods are presented and compared, with examples of their use. Students will undertake a term project working in small groups addressing the design of a relatively complex software system.</p>
