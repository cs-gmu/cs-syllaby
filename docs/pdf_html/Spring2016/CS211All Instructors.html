Each programming project will have an "Honors Problem" which honor
section (H01) students must complete.  Other sections are not required
to do these sections and will not receive any credit for completing
them but are free to try. The normal projects will normally be scored
out of 100 points, and earning 100 points would be a perfect
score. The honors problem will be some additional amount of points. If
a particular project had a 15 point honors problem, then they would
need 115 points to get a perfect score. Disregard blackboard's "points

<p>
<b>No collaboration is allowed on programming projects unless explicitly
indicated in the project description.</b>  Utilize the discussion board
and office hours of course staff if you have questions about the
projects.
</p>

<p>
Project grading will usually be divided into two portions weighted 50%
for each portion.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automatic Testing (50%): Public tests will be used to assess the
correctness of programs.  Running these tests while constructing
your program will indicate exactly what your score on this portion
will be.
</li>
<li>Manual Inspection (50%): Each project will include a checklist of
features your programs should exhibit. These usually comprise
things that cannot be easily checked via unit tests such as good
variable name selection, proper decomposition of a problem into
multiple functions or cooperating objects, overall design elegance,
and proper asymptotic complexity.  These features will be checked
by graders and assigned credit based on level of compliance.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The policies for project submission are as follows.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Projects each have a deadline; no late work is accepted more than 48
hours after the deadline, and penalties for late work apply (see
below). Work turned in more than 48 hours late doesn't count.
</li>
<li>Each student starts the semester with three Day-Late Tokens.
Whenever a student turns in a project late, tokens are
<b>automatically</b> applied to the assignment.
</li>
<li>A "ceiling penalty" of 25% is assessed each 24-hour period entered
after the deadline (when late-tokens are gone). For example, if you
turn in work half a day late (one 24-hour period late), you can't
earn higher than 75%.
</li>
<li>Work turned in more than <b>two 24-hour periods late will earn zero
points</b> and will only be inspected as a courtesy (no grade assigned)
as time permits. To clarify, you can't use tokens and/or penalties
to turn work in 3 days late; this would earn zero points, because it
has missed the 48-hour-late hard deadline.
</li>
<li>You can submit work to BlackBoard as many times as desired.  Only
the last submission will be graded, and all others are ignored. If
you anticipate being rushed around the submission deadline, be sure
to submit a version before the deadline as a backup, in case you
find yourself only moments late in meeting a deadline, or your wifi
goes out at the last moment.
</li>
<li>GTAs grade the programming projects for the lab sections they teach.
</li>
<li>On-time submissions will generally be graded and available a week
from submission, though exceptional circumstances may cause delays.
Late submissions will be graded in as timely a fashion as schedules
allow.
</li>
<li><i>Be sure you actually turned in your work!</i> We need <code>.java</code> files;
<code>.class</code> files are worthless as a submission. If you tend to keep
earlier versions in extra files, make sure you turned in the final
product, as that is what will be graded.
</li>
<li><b>BACK UP</b> your work, always! Without fail, each semester multiple
students will lose, drown, crack, reformat, magnetize, or generally
destroy their computers at the worst possible time. Keep everything
somewhere backed up, such as a DropBox or Google Drive folder, so
that this doesn't happen to you.

Grading projects for H01 students will be out of total points
available including the honors section: each project will have 100
points plus an honors section, frequently worth up to 20 points.  In
