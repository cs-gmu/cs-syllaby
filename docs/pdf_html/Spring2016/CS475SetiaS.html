        <br>
      </b>CS 367 (Computer Systems &amp; Programming)</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This is a programming intensive course.
      You need
      to be comfortable with programming in C and Java to be able to do
      the
      programming assignments. It is also not a good idea to take this
      class
      if
      your course/work schedule is already quite full.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b><i>DESCRIPTION
          :</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b></b>The class
      focusses
      on issues that arise in the design and
      implementation
      of concurrent and distributed applications. Course work will
      involve
      several
      programming assignments.<br>

      <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental concepts in
        synchronizing concurrent processes and threads by using locks,
        semaphores and monitors<br>

        </i></b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b><i></i></b>Unfortunately
there
      is no single textbook that covers all the
      material that will be discussed in this class. The following
      books are
      recommended (not required):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Randal Bryant &amp; David O'Halloran. Computer Systems: A
        Programmer's Perspective, Prentice Hall, 3rd edition (2015) </li>
      <li> <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eremzi/OSTEP/">
          Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces </a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Class notes will also be provided as necessary. Recommendations
      for
      additional books on specific topics (Network programming, Web
      services, Distributed Systems) will be provided by the instructor.</p>
    <hr><b><i>TOPICS:</i></b><br>
    <p>The following topics will be covered:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Multi-threaded/Concurrent Programming</li>
      <li>Distributed Systems</li>
      <li>Client-Server Applications</li>
      <li>Middleware technologies
        <ol>
          <li>TCP/IP Sockets</li>
          <li>RPC/RMI</li>
          <li>Web Services (SOAP, XML)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Advanced topics (time permitting) - Peer to Peer Computing,
        Parallel Programming
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p><b><i>GRADING:</i></b></p>
    <p>There will be four programming assignments (two dealing with
      concurrent programming and two with distributed/networked
      applications). The software required for these projects is
      available on the computers in the VS&amp;E&nbsp;Lab. You can also
      do
      the
      projects on your own computer. (The programming assignments
      involve
      programming in C or Java on a UNIX/Linux platform.)&nbsp; You can
      do the assignments individually or in a group of two students. <br>
    </p>
    <p>65% of the course grade will be based on the programming
      assignments. In
      addition, there will be a mid-term exam in March worth 15% of the
      grade. The
      final exam will account for the remaining 20% of the grade.<br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p><b><i>LATENESS:</i></b> <br>
      <br>
      The late submission policy is as follows: you have five <b>slip
        days</b> that you can use during the course of the semester, but
      at most two slip days per assignment. An assignment is considered
      late by one day irrespective of whether you miss the deadline by 1
      minute or up to 24 hours.
