<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">This course will cover 
essentials of Computer Vision, a discipline 
that strives to develop techniques to help computers "see" and
understand images. The course is of interest to anyone
seeking to process images and acquire a general background in problems
related to real-world perception, object and scene
recognition and 3D reconstruction. The geometric aspects of the course will focus on extracting
3D metric information from 2D images. The second theme
covers methods for extraction of semantic information. This
will entail problems of image classification, object detection
(e.g. how to detect people, cars or other object of interest in
images), activity recognition. Aplications to 3D modelling, video analysis, 
 video surveillance, image based retrieval, object detection and recognition and
vision based control will be discussed. &nbsp;  <br> <br>

<p> <b> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Academic Integrity: </b> <br>
   <blockquote>
      The integrity of the University community is affected by the
      individual choices made by each of us. GMU has an Honor Code
      with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three
      fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times
      are that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the
      work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full
      credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain
      about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for
      clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic
      misconduct. Plagiarism means using the exact words, opinions, or
      factual information from another person without giving the
      person credit. Writers give credit through accepted
      documentation styles, such as parenthetical citation, footnotes,
      or endnotes. Paraphrased material must also be cited, using MLA
      or APA format. A simple listing of books or articles is not
      sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery
      and cannot be tolerated in the academic setting. If you have any
      doubts about what constitutes plagiarism, please see me. <br> <br>
