	  <li><h3>Course Information</h3><p>
	  <span class="section">Course Description:</span><p></p> Most high-level programming languages (and particularly Java) insulate the programmer from the realities of the hardware on which the programs will run. C is the exception since it was originally designed to implement the Unix operating system. C offers the programmer direct access to much of the underlying hardware and, for programs running under Unix, direct access to operating system services. For these reasons C remains the language of choice for systems programming. <p/>
      <span class="section">Course Outcomes</span><p/>
<p>
By the end of the semester, students will:

     <ul>
       <li> Be able to implement, test and debug a designed solution to a problem in a low-level programming language, specifically the C programming language.


<li>Have a good understanding of C language constructs such as pointers, dynamic memory management, and address arithmetic.

<li>Have a good understanding of C libraries for input and output, and the interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system.
<li>Have the ability to use UNIX tools for program development and debugging.
      </ul>
      <p>
      <li><h3>Coursework</h3><p>
      <span class="section">Programming assignments</span><p/><p>
Students will receive a number of programming projects (3)during the semester. These programming projects will be a primary focus of your grade - each one should take multiple sessions of coding, with questions asked in between. Don't be surprised if you're spending 20+ hours on each one. All project grades will be averaged together evenly. Programming projects are INDIVIDUAL work.<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Submission</b>
<ul>
<li>All projects are to be submitted to Blackboard. You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard, and by default only the last version will be graded.
<li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero. You can and should download your submitted attempts to verify that you turned in a working copy.
<li>Broken Code == Bad Scores. Any code turned in that does not compile is likely to receive a zero. Make sure your code compiles and runs correctly before submission. </ul>
<p></p>
<li><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>
          Submission times are automatically recorded by Blackboard, and 
          there's no distinction between a tiny bit late and nearly a day 
          late - plan ahead to make sure that your submission is on time.
        </li>
<li>Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.
<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who forgot to (frequently) back up your work!
</ul>
   </ul>  

        <span class="section">Lab Assignments:</span> A short programming assignment will be given at the beginning of each lab.  The lab instructor and one or more UTAs will be available to help students with the assignment. If not completed, the lab may be taken home. Lab assignments will be due either at the designated time for submission on Blackboard or, if no due date is given on Blackboard, at the beginning of the following lab period. Attendance at labs is required.

        <span class="section">Tests:</span> individual work; online (you need Respondus browser lockdown installed to take tests.

      <span class="section">Grading Policies</span><p/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Grades within a category (i.e. tests, projects, labs) are
          weighted equally.
        </li>
        <li>Students must have Respondus Browser locakdown installed before taking any quiz or exams.</li>
        
        <li>
          The final exam is cumulative.        </li>
        <li>
          Challenging of any grade must occur within a week of when the 
          graded assignment has been returned.
        </li>
    <li><span class="alert"> To receive a passing grade in this course, the average score for all exams (Tests and Final exam) must be at least 60%.</span></li>
        <li>
          Any number of resubmissions are allowed (the most recent is used),
          however a resubmission turned in after the deadline will be 
          considered a late submission.
        </li>
          
        <li>
          In general, make-ups
          are not allowed except on exams ( under very special circumstances).
        </li>
        <li>Assignments are typically due at midnight on the listed due date.</li>
        <li>
          Late submission policy (up to 48 hours) is as follows: &lt;&equals;24 hours with 10% off, &gt;24 hours &&&lt;&equals;48 hours with 25% off,  &gt; 48 hours  will receive 0. For example, if you are late by 10 hours and you get 75 on the assignment, your final points will be 67.5. Submission times are automatically recorded by Blackboard, and there is no distinction between a minute late and a day late. Please plan ahead to make sure that your submission is on time. Taking backups regularly is highly recommended. 
        </li>
<li> Code must run on Mason's Zeus platform (zeus.ite.gmu.edu) using gcc. Students may develop programs using any computer
system they have available. However, submitted programs must run under gcc
compiler available on Mason. Your documentation should clearly state which software
was used for compilation, and once makefiles are introduced, a makefile should be
included with each assignment submission.

      <li><h3>Honor Code</h3><p>
      Unless specific instructions are given to the contrary, programming 
      assignments are an individual effort, no group work is allowed.  
      In addition to code, this includes the sharing of test cases, 
      pseudocode, or approaches, receiving assistance in debugging code,
      as well as the use of external Internet sites.<p>
      
      Both the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor 
      Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Department Honor Code</a> apply in this class.  Any use of a direct
      contribution on any program, homework, quiz, or exam will be
      reported as a violation of the honor code.<p>
We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure.<p>
Some kinds of participation in online study sites violate the Mason Honor code: these include accessing exam or quiz questions for this class; accessing exam, quiz, or assignment answers for this class; uploading of any of the instructor’s materials or exams; and uploading any of your own answers or finished work. Always consult your syllabus and your professor before using these sites.
      <p/>

	  <li><h3>Special Accommodations</h3><p>
      Students who have a right to accommodations due to disabilities or other
      conditions should discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
      Accommodations will follow the recommendations of the University's
      <a href="https://ds.gmu.edu/">Office of Disability Services</a>.
