This has lead to development of techniques to discover useful and interesting information from the large collections of data. This course aims to provide a overview of the key data mining methods and techniques like classification, clustering, and association rule mining. The course will also provide interesting application examples of data mining, especially in the field of social media analysis, text analysis and learning analytics.  This course will 
                      also provide an
