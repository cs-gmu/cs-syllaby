    <ul>
      <li> Compiler design</li>
      <li>Lexical analysis</li>
      <li>Syntax analysis - grammars, LL(1) parsers, LR(1) parsers</li>
      <li>Semantic processing</li>
      <li>Code generation and optimization </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><br>

    <p><u><b>NOTE:</b></u> CS 440 students may choose to use the grading
      policy and assignments associated with CS540 (cross-listed this
      semester). Any student who would like this to use the option must
      inform the professor <b>before the due date</b> for the first
      assignment and this decision is <b>binding</b>. I do not
      recommend this option for students who did not receive A grades in
      all (or most) of the pre-requisite classes. </p>
    <h2>2.2 Projects<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All projects must be done on an individual basis unless stated
        otherwise.</li>
      <li>All project grades are normalized and each contributes to your
        final grade evenly. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Incorrect/broken submissions:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero.</li>
        <li>Code that doesn't compile/run will likely get a very low
          score. It specifically MUST compile/run on <b>zeus.vse.gmu.edu</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>: </font>
        <ul>
          <li>Up to <b>48</b> hours late work accepted. Each day late
            drops the highest possible score by 25%.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Each student gets <b>two</b> "Emergency Day" tokens,
            which are <i>automatically</i> used by late submissions to
            avoid the 25% penalty. <br>
          </li>
          <li>Unused emergency-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a
            student's overall grade at the semester's end.</li>
          <li>Blackboard being unavailable is not an excuse for turning
            in a late assignment; in the rare situation that the website
            is somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the
            student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the
            deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
          <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
            extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any
            cloud service), emailing yourself, making multiple rounds of
            submissions to Blackboard, whatever it takes. <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.3 Written assignments<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All assignments must be done on an individual basis unless
        stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>One lowest written assignment score will be dropped when the
        semester total is calculated. All remaining grades are
        normalized and each contributes to your final grade evenly. </li>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>: </font> Written
        assignments are due by hard copies in lectures and <b>NO late
          submissions</b> are accepted. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.4 Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exams are closed book unless specified otherwise by
        instructor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>They will be entirely paper and pencil - no computers.</li>
      <li>All students must have their GMU identification available on
        testing days.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances
        (as judged by the professor) and must be arranged in advance.
        Vacation plans are not exceptional circumstances.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero. We may elect to allow the final exam to count the extra
        amount to give you a sort of do-over; we also reserve the right
        to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written. </li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.5 Discussion board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, Piazza,
        to ask and answer questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>No sharing answers to homework assignments on the discussion
        board.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Under no circumstances should code be posted publicly to the
        discussion board. Students can post questions and code
        privately, although the instructor reserves the right to make
        any post public, so that other students can see the responses. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.6 Other<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Contested Grades</b>: Contesting of grades on any/all
        submissions must be requested within one week of receiving the
        grade (on BlackBoard). No grade changes will be considered
        subsequent to that deadline.</li>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.<br>
      </li>
      <li>IN (Incomplete) policy as indicated in the catalog will be
        strictly adhered to. You must provide the necessary back-up
        documentation (e.g. medical certificate) for your application to
        be considered favorably. In all circumstances, the written
        request, with all the back up documentation, must be received
        before the final exam week.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><br>
    </h1>
    <h1>3 <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font></h1>
    <p>All students are expected to abide by the <a
        href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
      This policy is rigorously enforced. The computer science
      department has an <a
        href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
        Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our course<b>.&nbsp;





      </b>Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a
      notification of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor
      Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing, collaboration, or looking at
        any code, algorithm, or solutions of assignments that is not
        your own (or outside the group for group assignments), including
        resources from Internet, is considered cheating</font>. </p>
    <p> We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying
      or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code
      simply will not be tolerated. We use automated software to flag
      suspicious cases, and then review them to find the cases that must
      be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity. The penalty for
      cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure
      it's not worth taking the chance. <b>Confirmed cases of cheating
        almost always translate into course failure.</b> </p>
    <br>
    <h1>4 Learning Disabilities</h1>
    <p>Students with a learning disability or other condition
      (documented with GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of
        Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance
      should speak with the professor <b>ASAP</b> to discuss
      appropriate accommodations. <br>
