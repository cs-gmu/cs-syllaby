of at least 60 credit hours<b><br>
Req'd Textbooks: </b>Herman T. Tavani, "Ethics &amp;
Technology," 2nd or later ed.; Maddox, Tompkins, Maddox, "Supplementary
Cases and Materials," Spring, 2020.
<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is
intended to help students become effective professionals in the field
of computer science by examining many of the challenging legal and
ethical issues surrounding computer technology and its use, and
building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. Students will
examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how to
apply them to issues raised by computers and technology. Specific
topics covered in CS 105/110, such as intellectual property concerns, will
be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner. Emerging legal
and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce
will also be addressed. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much
of our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
may actually affect you. &nbsp;We hope to provide you with new insights,
and we may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;We expect that
you will bring us new insights as well. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU are the most
important component of this class, so please come prepared to think,
discuss, and argue!</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you disagree with their positions.</span></span> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Course Outcomes:</b><br></p><ol>

<li>Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.</li><li>Be able to connect issues of computer technology to wider
community and societal concerns using perspectives of law, ethics and
computer science.</li>

<li>Be able to communicate effectively in oral form.</li>
<li>Be able to communicate effectively in written form.</li>
<li>Be able to work with a partner and/or group to satisfy a
complex task.</li>
<li>Be able to apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the
quality, credibility and limitations of an argument or a solution using
appropriate evidence or resources.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Writing Intensive Component:</b> CS 306 is a
Writing Intensive (WI) Course that, together with CS 321, meets the GMU
WI Requirements for the BS CS and BS ACS programs. Accordingly, each
student in CS
306 is required to write a minimum of 1750 individual words, which will
be graded and returned to the student with feedback. This requirement
will be fulfilled&nbsp;by a series of short essays analyzing legal and
ethical issues, the first three of&nbsp;which may be revised and
resubmitted for an
improved grade after receiving feedback. &nbsp;These first three
essays&nbsp;must meet minimum wordcount requirements and earn a
final grade of C or better in order to receive a C or better in the
course. Students will also be writing in-class essays for short
exams. &nbsp;In addition, students
will
work with partners to research and write materials in preparation for
their&nbsp;Mock Trials or Creative Projects.&nbsp;</p>
