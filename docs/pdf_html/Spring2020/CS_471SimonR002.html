 There will be several programming projects.  The assignments will involve designing and implementing parts of an actual operating system called OS/161. You need to be  comfortable with programming in C to complete these assignments.  Details concerning OS/161 will be presented in class.<p>

<li>If your code does not compile, you will get no credit.</li>

Your grade will be calcuated as follows:

<UL>
<LI>30% Programming projects
</LI>
<LI>30% 2 Midterm exams, each 15%
</LI>
<LI>25% Final exam
</LI>
<LI>15% Homeworks and quizzes
</UL>

A final exam score of less than 50 results in an F for the course.  If you think your work as not be correctly graded then you must initiate contact with the grader within a week of receiving the grade (either in the lecture during which it was first handed out or on the Blackboard). Grade contesting beyond this time window will not be allowed.

Class attendance is not absolutely required but is <em>highly</em> recommended.





<P>No early exams will be given.  If you must miss an exam an makeup will be arranged at the discretion of the instructor, provided
you have a written and verified excuse.



<P>During the lectures, please make sure you avoid behavior that distracts others, including chatting, sleeping, or routinely arriving to class late. The use of <bf> any</bf> electronic device during class (including laptops, tablets, cell phones, smartphones, etc.) is not allowed. This means that you cannot sit there and sneak peeks at your cell. Violation of any of these policies will automatically result in points deducted from your final grade.

<p>If you have a learning or physical difference that may affect your academic work, you will need to furnish appropriate documentation to GMU Disability Resource Center. If you qualify for accommodation, the DRC staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations for your instructor. If you have such a condition, you must talk to the instructor during the first week of the term about the issue.
