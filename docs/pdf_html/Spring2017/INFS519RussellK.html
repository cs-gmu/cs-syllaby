	<h3>TEXTBOOKS</h3>
	<p>Mark Allen Weiss, Data Structures & Problem Solving Using Java, 4th ed., Addison-Wesley, 2010.</p>

	<h3>SOFTWARE & PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<p>You will need a computer for this class running some modern operating system capable of running a Java compiler. Remember that lab computers are also available on campus, see next section</p>
	<p>The prerequisite for this course is SWE 510 or its equivalent. I will assume a "semester's worth" of programming experience in Java. You should understand basic programming in Java including program design, coding, and debugging techniques.</p>

	<h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>
	<p>INFS 519 is designed to introduce students to the following topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dynamic lists</li>
		<li>Linked lists</li>
		<li>Stacks and queues</li>
		<li>Trees</li>
		<li>Graphs</li>
		<li>Generic classes</li>
		<li>Recursion</li>
		<li>Searching/Sorting</li>
		<li>Hashing</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We may also cover topics not listed above if time allows and there is sufficient interest.</p>

	<h3>CLASS REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A number of weekly programming assignments (probably 10)</li>
		<li>A number of larger programming projects (probably 2)</li>
		<li>Two comprehensive exams to assess the class progress (a midterm and a final)</li>
		<li>Reading</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h3>
	<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework code and exam solutions. The work you submit should be the product of your own effort and reflect your personal understanding.</b> Students may be asked at any time to explain code or exam solutions they submit. Inability to do so will be construed as evidence of misconduct.</p>
	<p>Both the University and the Computer Science Department have honor codes you are expected to adhere to. We will be reviewing these in class, but more information about the university honor code can be found here: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/</a> and the deparment's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/</a>. You are bound by these honor codes.</p>
	<p>Any submitted work which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors Committee. Any code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the project may be included in your programs.</p>
	
	<h3>GRADED ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
	<p>These will be announced online and in class and due 1 week (for weekly assignments) or 2 weeks (for projects) from the announcement date. Assignments/Projects should be turned in no later than midnight on the day they are due (GMU-time). The topics covered in each assignment/project will reflect one or more of the topics we are covering in class and/or the reading.</p>
	<p>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.</p>

	<h3>FINAL GRADES</h3>
	<p>Final grades will be assigned <i>without rounding</i> according to a 10-point scale per letter grade. Specifically:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Letter<br />Grade</th>
			<th>Score<br />Required</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A</td>
			<td>90% or above</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B</td>
			<td>80-89%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>70-79%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>D</td>
			<td>60-69%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>below 60%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<h3>SPECIAL POLICIES</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Laptops and Other Electronic Devices – will be allowed in class only at certain times.</li>
		<li>Attendance – is not required, but is strongly recommended.</li>
		<li>Group Work – is ok for reading and studying, but is not ok for: homework assignments, programming assignments, or exams.</li>
		<li>Late Assignments/Projects – will not be accepted without prior approval.</li>
		<li>Makeup Exams – require exceptional circumstances (as judged by me) and must be arranged in advance.</li>
	</ul>
