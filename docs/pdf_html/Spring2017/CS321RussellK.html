	<h3>TEXTBOOKS</h3>
	<p>While there is no specifically required textbook for this class, there is required readings. Readings will either be provided to you or be listed as chapters from the recommended textbooks. If you choose to use different textbooks, you will be responsible for "mapping" the reading from the recommended textbooks to your textbooks.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Software Modeling and Design: UML, Use Cases, Patterns, and Software Architectures by H. Gomaa (ISBN 10: 0521764149 / ISBN 13: 978-0521764148)</li>
		<li>Software Engineering by Ian Sommerville, some recent edition (e.g. 9th Edition, ISBN 10: 0137035152 / ISBN 13: 978-0137035151, or 10th Edition, ISBN 10: 0133943038 / ISBN 13: 978-0133943030).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>SOFTWARE &amp; PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<p>You will need a computer for this class with some modern operating system capable of running a Java compiler and some other misc. software. Remember that lab computers are also available on campus, see next section.</p>
	<p>The prerequisites for this course are a grade of C or better in CS 310 and ENGH 302. I will assume "three semesters' worth" of programming experience and knowledge of Java. You should understand basic program design, coding, and debugging techniques.</p>

	<h3>COURSE OUTCOMES</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>An understanding of all phases of the software engineering lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance).</li>
		<li>An understanding of several software lifecycle models including both prescriptive and agile models and knowledge of tradeoffs among these models.</li>
		<li>An ability to create and use UML models to develop and document software analysis and design artifacts.</li>
		<li>An understanding of fundamental project management and leadership issues for software teams.</li>
		<li>An ability to apply software engineering methods to address the requirements and design phases of a large software project.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>CLASS COMPONENTS &amp; REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Class Participation - During lectures we will discuss concepts needed to meet the course outcomes, I will provide demos relevant to course work, and you will occassionally have time to work with your team. Students are expected to attend and actively engage in lectures. Lack of attendance or participation will result in a reduced grade.</li>
		<li>Readings - Related to each lecture will be some amount of reading from the recommended textbook, provided papers, or some other resource.</li>
		<li>Quizzes - At the beginning of almost every lecture there will be a short (~5 minute) open book quiz on the reading material. These will take the place of the midterm.</li>
		<li>Office Hours - In addition to attending lectures, you are strongly encouraged to visit the professor and teaching assistant(s) during office hours to further your understanding of the material: we are here to help you learn. It is most helpful for help with team projects if at least two members of the team come together.</li>
		<li>Team Project - CS 321 will have a software engineering project that requires student to participate in working teams where students organize, manage, and practice a software engineering project. The team project will cover software requirements, design, coding and testing. Group members must participate equally in project assignments; the professor reserves the right to assign a zero to any student for any deliverable retroactively, if it turns out that nothing of academic merit was contributed to the assignment by any individual. It is up to students to prove their participation on deliverables.</li>
		<li>Writing Intensive (WI) Activities - CS321 includes Writing Intensive (WI) activities that, together with those of CS306, meet the GMU WI Requirements in the BS CS Program (<a herf="http://wac.gmu.edu">http://wac.gmu.edu</a>) This means you will write 1750 graded words (or about 7 standard pages). You will get feedback on some writing assignments and you will be able to resubmit revisions based on the feedback. For this course, part of the writing will include a software requirements specification, a software design document, and an individual essay on your experiences working with your team.</li>
		<li>Exam - There will be a comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester. Refer to the schedule for dates of the exams.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>GRADING POLICY</h3>

			<td>Team Project</td>
			<td>40%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Individual Writing Assignment</td>
			<td>10%</td>

	</table>
	
	<p>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.</p>
	
	<h3>FINAL GRADES</h3>
	<p>Final grades will be assigned without rounding according to the following criteria. It is a 10-point scale per letter grade, with the upper and lower 2% of each 10% earning a + or -.</p>
	<table border=0>
		<tr>
			<td>A+ (>= 98.0%) A (>= 92.0%) A- (>= 90.0%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>B+ (>= 88.0%) B (>= 82.0%) B- (>= 80.0%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C+ (>= 78.0%) C (>= 72.0%) C- (>= 70.0%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>D (>= 60.0%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>F (< 60.0%)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h3>
	<p><b>PRIME DIRECTIVE: Be able to explain your own work including homework, project deliverables, and exam solutions.</b> The work you submit should be the product of your own effort and reflect your personal understanding unless the assignment is explicitly stated to be a group assignment (in writing). Students may be asked at any time to explain their contributions or exam solutions they submit. Inability to do so will be construed as evidence of misconduct.</p>

	<p>Both the University and the Computer Science Department have honor codes you are expected to adhere to. We will be reviewing these in class, but more information about the university honor code can be found here: <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/</a> and the deparment's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/</a>. You are bound by these honor codes.</p>
	<p>Any submitted work which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely original, or any plagiarized work, will result in a case for the Honors Committee. Any code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the project may be included in your programs.</p>
