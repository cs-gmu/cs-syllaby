      The C Programming Language</span>, 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 1988<br>
    <br>
    <hr><b>Class Description:</b> &nbsp;Most high-level programming languages
    (and particularly Java) insulate the programmer from the realities of the
    hardware on which the programs will run. C is the exception since it was
    originally designed to implement the Unix operating system. C offers the
    programmer direct access to much of the underlying hardware and, for
    programs running under Unix, direct access to operating system services. For
    these reasons C remains the language of choice for systems programming. <br>
    <p><i><b>Prerequisite:</b> C or better in CS 211 or CS 222.</i> </p>
    <hr><big><b>Course Topics:</b></big> &nbsp;This is a course on "low-level"
    programming using C. We will learn C with heavy emphasis on pointer
    operations. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span><big style="font-weight: bold;">Planned schedule of topics</big> (In
    no particular order. May change without warning.):
    <ul>
      <li>Compiling, Linking, Makefiles, using multiple source files</li>
      <li>C Types, Operators, and Expressions</li>
      <li>Basic I/O, Input and Output Libraries</li>
      <li>File I/O</li>
      <li>Control Flow</li>
      <li>Functions and Program Structure</li>
      <li>Strings<br>
      </li>
      <li>Pointers and Arrays</li>
      <li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
      <li>Structures</li>
      <li>Bitwise operations</li>
      <li>The Unix System Interface</li>
      <li>vi/vim</li>
      <li>Debugging and gdb<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b><big>Course outcomes</big></b><big>:</big><br>
    <br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to implement, test and debug a designed
    solution to a problem in a low-level programming language, specifically the
    C programming language. <br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate a good understanding of C language
    constructs such as pointers, dynamic memory management, and address
    arithmetic. <br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate a good understanding of C libraries for
    input and output, and the interface between C programs and the UNIX
    operating system. <br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate an ability to use UNIX tools for program
    development and debugging. <br>
    <br>
    <big><b>Grading: </b></big>&nbsp;In addition to the labs and projects there
    will be a midterm exam and a final. There will be no makeups on exams except
    under exceptional circumstances (as judged by me), and any such makeup must
    be arranged in advanced. Grades will be computed using a weighted average of
    these scores with the weights: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>lab assignments: 15%</li>
      <li>lab attendance: 5%</li>
      <li>programming projects: 30%</li>
      <li>quizzes/instructor evaluation: 10%</li>
      <li>midterm exams: 20%</li>
      <li>final exam: 20%</li>
    </ul>
    In addition, to get a passing grade in the course your exam average grade
    must be at least 60% average grade on exams <i>AND</i> you must submit all
    projects and labs. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Labs:</b>&nbsp; Attendance at labs is <span style="font-weight: bold;">required</span>.
    A short programming assignment will be given at the beginning of each lab.
    &nbsp;The lab instructor and one or more UTAs will be available to help
    students with the assignment. If not completed, the lab may be taken home.
    Lab assignments will be due either at the designated time for submission on
    Blackboard or, if no due date is given on Blackboard, at the <b>beginning</b>
    of the following lab period. Late lab assignments will automatically be
    assessed a 50% penalty. All labs must be submitted for a passing grade in
    the course.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Attendance:</b> Attendance at both class lectures and labs is required.
    &nbsp;Exams will stress material covered in class and lab sessions.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Projects:</b> &nbsp;In addition to the labs there will be several larger
    programming projects. &nbsp;Programming assignments will be posted on
    Blackboard as they are assigned and must be submitted on Blackboard by the
    assigned due date. &nbsp;If your program is incomplete, you may still submit
    it for partial credit. &nbsp;However, your code must run without obvious
    errors (even if all functionality is not present). &nbsp;Building your
    programs in a modular fashion and debugging as you go are crucial concepts
    in program development. &nbsp;Additionally, your TA relies on running your
    program as part of your grade determination. &nbsp;Accordingly, any
    programming assignment that is submitted but either does not compile or has
    major errors when it is run will receive no more than 50% credit.&nbsp; All
    projects must be submitted for a passing grade in the course.<br>
    <p><b>Late Projects: </b>Late projects will be penalized 10 points per day
      (incl. weekend days/holidays) for the first five days past the due date.
      After that time, late projects will be penalized 5 points per day for the
      next five days. The maximum late penalty will be 75 points. You should
      recognize that late work can cause major penalties, so start work early!
      If your program isn't the way you'd like it to be when the deadline is
      near, submit it anyway for partial credit. <b>In fact, submit early and
        often! </b> The system permits you to retrieve and resubmit your
      assignment until the due date, so you may resubmit if you improve your
      program prior to the deadline. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resubmissions
        after the deadline require approval of your TA</span> (s/he may already
      have graded your project). If you know that you wish to resubmit a new
      version after the deadline, it is your responsibility to notify your TA no
      later than the time of the deadline, so s/he will not grade the on-time
      submission. <b>No resubmissions may be made after a project has been
        graded.</b> </p>
    <b>Class Communications: &nbsp;</b>CS 262 will be using Piazza and
    Blackboard for most class communications. You are responsible for any
    notifications or information posted on Blackboard/Piazza either by your
    instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s), and you will need to check the
    systems regularly for such notices. Some information may be disseminated
    through these systems rather than in class. Individual communications with
    the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by email using your GMU email account.
    When you email, please be sure to include your name, the class number and
    the topic in the subject header. (E.g.: Subject: Jim Jones / CS 262-003 /
    Project 2)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Accommodations:</span> If you are a
    student with a disability, please see your instructor and contact the Office
    of Disability Services (ODS) at (703) 993-2474. All academic accommodations
    <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> be arranged through the ODS:
    http://ods.gmu.edu<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Honor Code Policies:</span> All students
    are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-2017-Honor-Code-and-Honor-System-Final.pdf">GMU
      Honor Code</a>. This policy is rigorously enforced. All class-related
    assignments are considered individual efforts unless explicitly expressed
    otherwise (in writing). Review the university honor code and present any
    questions regarding the policies to instructor.<br>
    <br>
    Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification
    of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. Sharing,
    collaboration, or looking at any code related to programming assignments
    that is not your own is considered cheating. See <span style="font-weight: bold;">Programming
      Polices</span> below.<br>
    <br>
    The computer science department has an additional, more restrictive <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
      Honor Code</a> that you are also subject to. Make sure you read and
    familiarize yourself with these rules.<br>
    <br>
    <hr> <b><br>
      PROGRAMMING POLICIES</b>
    <p>(1) <b>No sharing or discussion of code</b>. Unless specifically stated
      otherwise, all assignments are individual projects, not group projects.
      Students are expected to do their own work, not to share programs with
      each other, nor copy programs from anyone else. This means you may not
      discuss program design or strategize solutions with anyone except your
      instructor or a course UTA or GTA.<b> </b>However, you may offer more
      limited assistance to your fellow students regarding specific questions on
      their programming assignments by responding to queries on Blackboard. Any
      sharing of code or discussion of programming projects, except within the
      parameters of Blackboard, constitutes an honor code violation. Suspected
      honor code violations are taken very seriously, and will be reported to
      the Honor Committee. Read the&nbsp; <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-2017-Honor-Code-and-Honor-System-Final.pdf">GMU
        Honor Code</a> and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS
        Department Honor Code.</a> You are bound by these codes. </p>
    <p>(2) <b>No incorporation of code from any source external to the course</b><i>.</i>
      You may <u>not</u> incorporate code written by others, such as code found
      on the Internet or any of the numerous CS books available. You may freely
      use any code provided as part of the project specifications, without any
      need for crediting the source. However, if you use code provided by your
      instructor (other than that given as part of the project specifications)
      or from the course textbook, you must document what portion came from
      those sources. </p>
    <p>(3) <b>Blackboard/Piazza</b>. We encourage the use of Blackboard and/or
      Piazza to discuss assignments and assist one another with programming
      questions. You may ask questions or respond to queries on BB/Piazza
      regarding projects or other assignments, <b>so long as you do not post
        any C code or detailed pseudocode, and so long as you do not provide
        specific solutions to the overall problem or algorithm design (even in
        English)</b>. Often, students believe that "simple" code is acceptable
      to place on Blackboard/Piazza. However, because there is a wide variation
      in what different students and instructors regard as "simple," we must be
      very strict about the ban against Blackboard/Piazza code. <b>Only</b> an
      instructor, GTA or UTA is permitted to place code on blackboard unless it
      is code that has already been provided to all students (either as part of
      the assignment specification itself or within the class textbook). </p>
    <p>(4) <b>Discussing Blackboard/Piazza postings outside of
        Blackboard/Piazza</b>. Please note that <u>Blackboard or Piazza
        assistance must remain on the forum</u>. "Summarizing" Blackboard/Piazza
      statements or responses to another student verbally regarding an
      assignment is *not* acceptable, and is subject to the above ban on
      discussing assignment solutions. While it may seem harmless,
      Blackboard/Piazza was set up so that all assistance could be overseen by
      instructors/TAs/UTAs, and it is nearly impossible to truly duplicate
      Blackboard/Piazza discussion outside of the actual forum, thus creating
      the potential for either (unknowing) mistaken advice, or for unfair
      advantage by certain students. If you truly wish to assist a fellow
      student, encourage him or her to log onto Blackboard/Piazza, and direct
      him/her to specific postings you find helpful. </p>
    <p>(5) <b>Back up your program regularly.</b> You are expected to back up
      your program in separate files as you get different pieces working.
      Failure to do this may result in your getting a much lower grade on a
      program if last minute problems occur. (Accidentally deleting your
      program, having problems connecting, etc., will <u>not</u> be accepted as
      excuses.) </p>
    <p>(6) <b>Keep an untouched copy of your final code submission</b>. It is
      important that you not touch your programs once you have made your final
      submission. If there are any submission problems, consideration for credit
      will only be given if it can be verified that the programs were not
      changed after being submitted. </p>
    <p>(7) <b>Code must run on Zeus using gcc</b>. Students may develop
      programs using any computer system they have available. Please note,
      however, that submitted projects must run under the gcc compiler available
      on Zeus. Your documentation should clearly state which software was used
      for compilation, and once makefiles are introduced, a makefile should be
      included with each assignment submission. <u>No extensions</u> will be
      given due to compiler incompatibilities.<br>
