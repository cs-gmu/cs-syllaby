<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is
intended to help students become effective professionals in the field
of computer science by examining many of the challenging legal and
ethical issues surrounding computer technology and its use, and
building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. Students will
examine the philosophical bases for ethical decision-making and how to
apply them to issues raised by computers and technology. Specific
topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual property concerns, will
be addressed by this course in a more intensive manner. Emerging legal
and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce
will also be addressed. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why you should care:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This
is a course about law, ethics, and big ideas. &nbsp;We will spend much
of our time reading, discussing, and writing about actual legal cases
dealing with constitutional and computer-related issues. &nbsp;It is a
chance for you to understand how the law really works, and how it may
apply to your future career in computing. &nbsp;It is also an
opportunity to consider the ethics of many computer-related issues that
may actually affect you. &nbsp;I hope to provide you with new insights,
and&nbsp;I may challenge what you think you know! &nbsp;I expect that
you will bring me new insights as well. &nbsp;YOU are the most
important component of this class, so please come prepared to think,
discuss, and argue! &nbsp;At the same time, remember to treat others respectfully, even if you disagree with their positions.</span> </p>
