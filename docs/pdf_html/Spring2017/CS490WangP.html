      <h3> CS 490 Design Exhibition</h3>
      <b>Spring 2017</b><br/>
        Fridays 10:30 am - 1:10  pm<br/>
        Robinson B 106
        <br />
      

      <p><h4>Course Description:</h4>      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        This course provides computer science majors with an opportunity to work on a semester-long
        project or research paper that is more substantial than the projects or 
        papers assigned in other CS classes. To achieve this creative goal,
        students may work in teams or individually.
        CS faculty members can also serve as mentors of the project
        or research paper, and the effort will be coordinated by 
        the course instructor.  
        <p>
        Milestones throughout the semester must be met for successful completion of the course.
        These include submission of initial design specification documents, bi-weekly progress 
        reports and presentations, development of assessment criteria to measure student success,
        final project/paper report with accompanying software artifacts, and a formal presentation 
        of the project/research paper at the end of the semester.
        <p>
        For BS CS students, this course can be used as both a CS-related and CS-Senior elective. 
        For ACS majors, this course can be used to satisfy the ACS CS 400-level course requirement for all concentrations.
        </p>

      <blockquote>
            Please note that students will only receive a final grade of C or better in this class 
            if a project or the research paper is <i>completed</i>.  Late coursework will not be accepted. 
The course grade is based on three components:
         <blockquote>
         (1) Class participation: <b>20%</b> <br>
            <blockquote>Bi-weekly progress reports, demos and/or presentations; attendance is mandatory.

         <p>
         (2) Deliverables:  <b>60%</b>
            <blockquote> 20% - Project design/research plan documents, including bi-weekly document revisions (see Timetable)<br><p>
                       40% - A final project report including documented software
                       and/or project-generated artifacts if a project is to be implemented. For a research paper,
                       a final document that shows evidence of an original contribution that includes 
                       comparison to previous work in the literature must be submitted.
            <p>
            </blockquote>
