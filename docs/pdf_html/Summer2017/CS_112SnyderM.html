extra credit for getting our practice problems correct in class,

you'll need access to something - a laptop, phone, tablet - that

for participation until the tool is ready.

In general, all grades should be available about one week after the
deadline. We will often have Sunday project deadlines (plus 48 hours
of late work accepted), so you would usually get a grade posted by the
following Wednesday.

<p>
Programming projects will be a primary focus of your experience,
progress, and grade - each one should take multiple sessions of
coding, with questions asked in between. This is the practice you need
to learn, master, and internalize various concepts of the
course. Don't be surprised if you're spending 5-20 hours on each one.
</p>

accelerated summer schedule; we operate at twice the pace, and

<li>Each project has a posted deadline.
</li>
<li>No late work is accepted 48 hours after the posted deadline.
</li>
<li>Each student starts the semester with three <b>One-Late-Day</b> tokens.
</li>
<li>Late projects either automatically consume a late-day token when
available, or incur a 25% late penalty.
</li>
<li>projects can be turned in at most 48 hours late, <i>no exceptions.</i>
</li>
<li>each student gets three <b>One-Late-Day</b> tokens, which are
automatically used by submissions that are between 0-48 hours late.
you still must turn in work within 48 hours of the original
deadline, even if you use tokens! (note that you can't use three
tokens on a single project - pace yourself!)
</li>
<li>each 24-hour period entered after the posted deadline either
automatically spends a One-Late-Day token if you still have any
remaining, or it lowers the maximum score by 25% (not quite the
same as a 25% penalty - it's better for you!).
</li>
<li>the last project might not be allowed to be turned in late, to
facilitate end-of-semester grading.
</li>
<li>tokens are only allowed on projects; they can't be used on anything
else, so no usage on labs or readings.

After the first two projects, any code turned in that does not run
(immediately crashes due to errors), specifically on Python 3.6.0,
will receive at most 50%. At this point, if the grader is able to
quickly fix your code, you might get some points back. If the grader
cannot immediately spot and fix the issue, you'll be fortunate to get
any points at all.

You can submit your work an unlimited number of times to BlackBoard,

download your submitted attempts, and verify that you turned in a
working copy.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a zero.

<li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
extension. <b>Use a backup service</b> such as DropBox (or any cloud
service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
takes. Every semester multiple students have their computers die,
have computers stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the
student who forgot to (frequently) back up your work - it'll cost
tokens and a rushed re-implementation!

assessments will be weekly exercises, tasks, or quizzes, to be

<li>Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the
reason why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major
award, getting married, saving the universe, etc.). This is the
reason you get lab drops!

<li>We will <b>drop the lowest two grades</b> from this category.

<li>If you choose to miss some early on, and later on have to miss for
some understandable reason, that is too bad. Try to save the drops

<li><b>You must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b> This is a
departmental policy for CS 112. You also need to have a passing
percentage grade, of course, but failure on the final exam
indicates a systemic lack of true progress. Generally, students who
fail the final exam do not have a passing grade in the course
anyways. ("passing" the final exam means scoring 60% or better.)
</li>
<li>there will only be a curve if specific questions end up being too
ambiguous or otherwise obviously unfair - I don't target some
mythical bell curve; everyone can do very well!

<li>If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the
grader. For all projects and lab work, that is either your GTA who
leads the lab section, or another GTA who signed their name on the
grading comments under rare circumstances. For the tests and final
exam, that is your professor.
</li>

<li>If you have not initiated contact within a week of a grade being
posted to BlackBoard, it is too late. We cannot entertain a swarm
of contested grades at the eleventh hour to try to maximize
end-of-semester grades. Keep up with your grades throughout the
semester.
</li>

<li>We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often
through specific test cases, which are often automated as part of
the grading process. All GTAs coordinate together with a shared
scoring breakdown and regularly communicate with each other before,
during, and after the grading process to keep it fair.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic
culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure
of your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we
must ensure that all work that should be your own <i>is</i> your own.
</li>

<li>Note that the CS department doesn't have any "extra" policy for the
honor code on top of the university's. The documents shared below
help you to understand how it applies to programming and CS but
they don't actually restrict it at all.
</li>

<li>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or
sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code
simply will not be tolerated. <b>This includes using code found on the internet</b>.
</li>

<li>There are definitely opportunities to study, work, and learn
together throughout this course - Zyante questions, exercises, and
more. Mostly you will need to work independently for any sort of
"test" and for projects.
</li>

<li>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work
from a friend, or even to just work on the project on your own
machines next to each other, remember that it is just as easy to
compare your work automatically and electronically, and discover
the similarities in text and structure. We use automated software
to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to find the
cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity.
Repeat to yourself: <b>it's not worth trying to cheat.</b> We will catch
it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.
</li>

<li>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero
grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. Confirmed cases
of cheating almost always translate into course failure.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students with a learning disability or other condition (documented
with GMU's Office of Disability Services) that may impact academic
performance should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss
appropriate accommodations. We are quite happy to assist as is
appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time. Bringing the
accommodation paperwork with you to a scheduled assessment is far
too late! Even if you don't know if you plan on utilizing the
accommodations ahead of time, it's in your best interest to prepare
ahead of time.
