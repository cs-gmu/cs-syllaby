<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Course Scope: </b>In this course, a
thorough examination of several well-known techniques that are used for
the design and analysis of algorithms will be covered. Topics to be covered
include theoretical measures of algorithm complexity, sorting and selection
algorithms, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer techniques, dynamic programming,
graph algorithms, search strategies, and an introduction to the theory
of NP-completeness. Additional topics may be covered if time permits. Students
are expected to have taken prior undergraduate courses in data structures
and algorithms, as well as calculus and discrete mathematics. Programming
skills are also a prerequisite.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prerequisites:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CS 310 and CS 330 Calculus (MATH 113,
114, 213) and MATH 125 Familiarity with a high-level programming language</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Required Textbook:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos:
Algorithm Design</font></b>


<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Course Requirements:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will be a midterm examination, several
practice homework assignments, one programming projects and a comprehensive
final examination. All required assignments must be completed by the stated
due date and time. Late coursework will not be accepted and make-up tests
will not be given for missed examinations. Please note that all coursework
is to be done independently- see the GMU Honor Code System and Policies
at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html">http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol.html </a>.</font>

<p> <b> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Course Outcomes: </b> <br>

Students will gain an understanding of classical
problems in Computer Science and practical knowledge and understadning
of commonly used algorithm design and analysis strategies.
They will gain an ability to analyze the computability of a problem
and design and analyze new algorithms to solve a computational
problem often encountered in practical applications. 
The students will gain ability to reason algorithmically.

<p> <b> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Academic Integrity: </b> <br>
   
      The integrity of the University community is affected by the
      individual choices made by each of us. GMU has an Honor Code
      with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three
      fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times
      are that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the
      work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full
      credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain
      about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for
      clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic
      misconduct. Plagiarism means using the exact words, opinions, or
      factual information from another person without giving the
      person credit. Writers give credit through accepted
      documentation styles, such as parenthetical citation, footnotes,
      or endnotes. Paraphrased material must also be cited, using MLA
      or APA format. A simple listing of books or articles is not
      sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery
      and cannot be tolerated in the academic setting. If you have any
      doubts about what constitutes plagiarism, please see me. <br> <br>
