<h3>Important</h3>
This class is a seminar!
It is not a lecture class.
<em><b>Students should expect to contribute heavily to the class.</b></em>

<h3>
Course Description</h3>
This version of SWE 737 is about advanced testing techniques.
The heart of the course is a testing-related research project,
drawn from one of three areas:
<UL>
<LI>
Context-based approaches to mutation testing.
This project has substantial infrastructure already
built and is suitable for a variety of semester-long research projects.
<LI>
Empirical studies in evaluating methods for choosing components for test automation.
This is a small MITRE-funded project that might be of interest
to one or two students.
<LI>
A testing-related research project identified by the student
and approved by the instructor.
</UL>
<h3>
Degree Credit for PhD IT Students</h3>
This class counts towards the
"Select at least 18 credit hours with at least 12 credits at the 700 level as follows"
requirement
in the 
<a href="https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/information-technology-phd/#requirementstext">
Software Engineering Advanced Emphasis Requirement</a>.
<br>
Note:  The CS department approved adding SWE 737 to this list in 2016, 
but a clerical error
resulted in it not appearing in the 2017-2018 catalog.  
Nonetheless, the vote is what is binding, and hence
the course <b>does</b> count towards this requirement.

<h3>
Course Materials</h3>
<ul>
<LI>

We will use 
Piazza
<!--
<a href="https://piazza.com/gmu/fall2014/swe737/home">Piazza</a>
-->
for discussions and posting (most) material.

<LI>
Material on context-based mutation.
We'll start with the most recent paper on the topic (ISSTA 2017)
<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~rjust/publ/customized_mutants_issta_2017.pdf">
Inferring Mutant Utility from Program Context</a>.
<LI>
Additional papers will be listed prior to the first meeting of the class.
</ul>

<H3>
Approximate Schedule: Revisions likely!
</H3>
<ul>
<li>
First few weeks: General (re)orientation in testing.
I plan to lead some of these discussions,
but heavy student participation is expected.
<LI>
Middle section of the semeter:
Student presentations of papers from the literature.
<LI>
Last few weeks of the semester:
Student presentations of projects/papers.
This will cover <i>your</i> work.
</ul>

<h3>
Assignments/Expectations
</h3>

<p>
There are three specific expectations  of students
in this class.
<UL>
<LI>
The simplest is that each student come to lecture prepared
to discuss the topic of the day.
This is a seminar, not a lecture.
Each student is expected to add value to the discussion.
<p>
Discussions will continue outside of class on a Piazza forum.
Again, students are expected to contribute.
<LI>
Each student will <i>lead</i> one or two discussions
in class, as well as one or more online discussions.
This will involve selecting suitable material,
making it available to other students,
and preparing a presentation to guide the discussion.
You should begin researching what topics you would like
to present <i>now</i>.
You should have clear your ideas with me a couple of weeks
before you are scheduled to present.
<P>
Group work is certainly allowed - even encouraged -
depending on what is most appropriate for the specific topic.
<LI>
Each student will prepare a project or paper on
some advanced testing technique.
Again, you should discuss your ideas with me
as early as possible.
<P>
Group work is possible in this aspect of the course as well, 
but requires a strong rationale and prior instructor approval.
</UL>

<p>
PhD students should aim for a paper/project
that is potentially publishable.
Often, such papers require additional work outside the
scope of the class to bring them to the level of
quality required to satisfy a typical set of reviewers.
MS students are also welcome to aim
for publication.
However, many MS students are often interested
in more practical applications.

<h3>
Grading</h3>
Grades are computed as: Class participation (25%);
Discussion leading (25%);
Project (50%).
