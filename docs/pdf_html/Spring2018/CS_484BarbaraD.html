<P align=left><B>Overview</B> <BR>This course provides an introduction 
to the
fundamental concepts in Data Mining </P>Course Outcomes:
<UL>
  <LI>The ability to apply computing principles, probability and 
statistics
  relevant to the data mining discipline to analyze data.
  <LI>A thorough understanding of model programming with data mining 
tools,
  algorithms for estimation, prediction, and pattern discovery.
  <LI>The ability to analyze a problem, identifying and defining the 
computing
  requirements appropriate to its solution: data collection and 
preparation,
  functional requirements, selection of models and prediction 
algorithms,
  software, and performance evaluation.
  <LI>The ability to understand performance metrics used in the data 
mining
  field to interpret the results of applying an algorithm or model, to 
compare
  methods and to reach conclusions about data.
  <LI>The ability to communicate effectively to an audience the steps 
and
  results followed in solving a data mining problem (through a term 
project)

<P><B>Class Attendance</B><BR>Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on 
time.&nbsp; I
expect to start at 4:30 sharp; Please participate in class! Ask 
questions if
there is something you don't understand.
<P><B>Grading Policies</B><BR>There will also be written homeworks, a 
final
project, a in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. Both the final and 
midterm
are open-book and open-notes. The final exam will be 
<B>comprehensive</B>, i.e.,
it will cover the entire course. Missed exams must be arranged with the
instructor BEFORE the exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the illness (doctor's 
note)
is required.&nbsp; No early exams will be given and make-up exams are 
strongly
discouraged.
<P></P>End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows 
(tentative
plan):
<UL>
  <LI>40% Assignments
  <LI>30% Exams (Quizes)
  <LI>30% project </LI></UL>In order to obtain an A, your final score 
should be
<I>at least</I> 90. A total score of 49 or less will result in an F.
<P><B><A name=Late></A>Late Policy</B></P>Late homework will be 
accepted with a
penalty of 20% per day within 3 days after deadlines and will not be 
accepted
three days after due, unless under prearranged conditions.
<P><B>No smartphones, LAPTOPS, TABLETS, or recorders allowed in class. Lectures cannot be recorded without special permission
