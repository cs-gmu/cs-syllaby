<h1>Computer Science CS 480 / C01</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>	

<p><h3>Meets</h3> MTWR, 10:30 am - 12:35 pm, in Art and Design Building L008

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>

<p><h3>About the Class</h3>  This course explores principles and methods for knowledge
    representation, reasoning, learning, problem solving, planning,
    heuristic search, and natural language processing and their
    application to building intelligent systems in a variety of
    domains.  LISP programming language is used.

<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>
CS330 and CS310, no exceptions.

<p><h3>Textbooks</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd ed.,
  Russell & Norvig, Prentice Hall
  <li> ANSI Common Lisp, Graham, Prentice-Hall (recommended)
  </ol>

<p><h3>Software</h3>
We will use Common Lisp for homework assignments and projects. You
  should install Lisp on your personal computer. I will teach some
  lisp programming in class.
 
<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> <a
  href="https://piazza.com/gmu/summer2016/cs482/home">CS 480:
  Introduction to AI </a> We will communicate through piazza. Slides, handouts, and assignments will be posted on the web page.

<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be based on a combination of the following factors:
  <ol>
   <li> Homework: 30%
<li> Project 20% (about every 2 weeks).
<li> Midterm: 25%.
<li> Final: 25%.
</ol>

<P><h3>Honor Code</h3> The class enforces the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science.  You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.

<P><h3>Laptops Etc.</h3> Use of laptops, iPads, cell phones, and similar devices are not permitted in the class, except with permission from the instructor.

<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you heve a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.

<p><h3>Course Outcomes</h3> 
 
<span class="list">1.</span> A knowledge of basic uninformed and heuristic search techniques. 
<span class="list">2.</span> A knowledge of basic logic or probabilistic reasoning techniques. 
<span class="list">3.</span> A knowledge of basic machine learning techniques. 
<span class="list">4.</span> An ability to implement basic AI methods in Lisp or in Prolog. 
<span class="list">5.</span> An ability to identify and apply an appropriate AI method to a given problem.
