<P align=left><B>Overview</B> <BR>This course provides an introduction to the 
fundamental concepts in computer architecture. Topics include: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Basic system components 
  <LI>Performance measurements 
  <LI>Instructions and their representation 
  <LI>Number representation 
  <LI>Implementation of Arithmetic operations 
  <LI>Processor organization 
  <LI>Pipelining 
  <LI>The memory hierarchy </LI></UL>
Course Outcomes:
<UL>
  <LI> 	
Be able to explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional components 
<LI>	
Be able to compare performance of simple system configurations and understand the performance implications of architectural choices 
<LI>
Be able to show how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler; be able to understand small MIPS programs and write MIPS assembly program segments 
<LI>
Be able to use different formats to represent numerical data and convert 
numerical data from one format to another 
<LI>	
Be able to explain how an instruction is executed and the concept of datapaths and control 
<LI>	
Be able to explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur 
<LI>	
Be able to explain the effect of memory latency on running time; be able to describe the use of memory hierarchy to reduce the effective memory latency, in 

particular, the role of cache and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management 
<LI>
Be able to explain the basic I/O implementation and data transfers

<P><B>Class Attendance</B><BR>Required.&nbsp; Please arrive on time.&nbsp; I 
expect to start at 4:30 sharp; Please 
participate in class! Ask questions if there is something you don't understand. 
<P><B>Grading Policies</B><BR>There will also be written homeworks, a in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. 
Both the final and midterm 
are open-book and open-notes. The final exam will be <B>comprehensive</B>, 
i.e., it will cover the entire course. Missed exams must be arranged with the 
instructor BEFORE the exam.&nbsp; Documentation of the illness (doctor's note) 
is required.&nbsp; No early exams will be given and make-up exams are strongly 
discouraged. 
<P></P>End-of-semester numeric scores will be weighted as follows (tentative 
plan): 
<UL>
  <LI>40% Assignments 
  <LI>60% Exams 
  <UL>
    <LI>25% midterm 
    <LI>35% final </LI></UL>
  </UL>In order to obtain an A, your final score 
should be <I>at least</I> 90. A total score of 49 or less will result in an F. 
<P><B><A name=Late></A>Late Policy</B></P>Late homework will be accepted with a 
penalty of 20% per day within 3 days after deadlines and will not be accepted 
three days after due, unless under prearranged conditions. 
<P><B><FONT color=#d50000>Honor Code</FONT></B><BR>You are expected to abide by 
the honor code.&nbsp; All assignments and exams are individual efforts. Please 
refer to <A href="http://jiju.gmu.edu/catalog/apolicies/honor.html">GMU Academic 
Policies</A> and <A 
href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">Computer 
Science Department Honor Code</A>.&nbsp; <B>Any violation of the honor code will 
result in a zero of the assignment/exam, and may result in an F for the class.
