</p><p><b>Current Catalog Description</b>
</p><p><b>Data communication and networking protocols, with study organized to follow layers of the
Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP family of protocols). Topics include role of various media and
software components, local and wide area network protocols, network performance, and
emerging advanced commercial technologies.</b>
</p><p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</p><p><b>The course will present techniques and systems for communication of data
between computational devices and the layers of the Internet Protocol Suite.
Topics include the role of various media and software components, local and wide
area network protocols, network design, performance and cost considerations, and
emerging advanced commercial technologies. Emphasis is on the TCP/IP family of
protocols. The ISO 7-layer reference model to organize the study. Students will
program simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project.</b>

<br><p><b>Course Outcomes</b>
<br>1. Explain basic electrical engineering principles that enable communication at the
physical layer
<br>2. Demonstrate an understanding of wired and wireless data link layer protocols for
shared medium and point-to-point communication
<br>3. Demonstrate an understanding of the graph theory concepts required for unicast
and multicast routing
<br>4. Demonstrate an understanding of distributed routing protocols
<br>5. Describe how protocols and applications use ARQ algorithms for distributed
reliability
<br>6. Demonstrate an understanding of end-to-end transport layer protocols
<br>7. Explain basic concepts in cryptography and networking security protocols.
<br>8. Illustrate fundamental understanding of networking by programming portions of
the entire network stack.
<br>9. Demonstrate a basic understanding of performance analysis for computer
networking
<br>10. Demonstrate a basic working vocabulary of data communications and networking terminology

<br>* 35% Final exam



</p><p><b>Project: We will use the Java Network Workbench (JNW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the JNW environment, as described in the required text by Pullen.

JNW is available for download from
<a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets">http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets</a>.
Well commented code must be submitted for grading via an upload
webpage at <a href="http://netlab.gmu.edu/CS455-upload">http://netlab.gmu.edu/CS455-upload</a>.
Additional projects will be available for extra credit. Student problems with
the project are to be addressed to the TA, who may refer them the instructor as needed. </b>
Additional project information will be found at

</p><p>


</p><p><b>Project credit breakout: JDLC1, JDLC2, JLAN1, JWAN2, JTRN1, JTRN2 five
points each; extra credit assignments to be announced.</b>
</p><p><b>Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam
date.</b>
</p><p><b>Assignments are due by 17:30 on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit. No project submission will be accepted after last lecture day (11/30/2008).</b>
</p><p><b>All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">
elaborated for Computer Science</a>. Students should be aware that their
submissions may be checked by plagiarism detection software.</b>
</p><p><b>Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity
of (but not higher than) A&nbsp; 93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B- 80; C 70.</b>
</p><p><b>Extra credit is available by doing extra projects; however, no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.</b> <br>&nbsp;
