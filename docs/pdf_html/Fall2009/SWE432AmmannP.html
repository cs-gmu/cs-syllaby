SWE 432: Design and Implementation of Software for the Web
</h1>
</center>

<hr>


<h3>Course Description</h3>

<!-- From the catalog -->
<P>
  This course teaches students how to develop software for web applications.
  The concepts of client-server computing,
  theories of usable graphical user interfaces,
  and models for web-based information retrieval and processing
  are covered.
  In the past few years,
  the way software is built has been rapidly changing.
  As use of the world wide web has shifted
  from information presentation
  to information gathering
  to direct customer sales
  and to business-to-business e-commerce,
  the amount and complexity of software has steadily been increasing.
  At the same time,
  new models of programming
  and new technology for designing and developing the software
  has made this complex software easier to build.
  As a result,
  there are many opportunities for personnel that have a light background
  in Computer Science theory,
  but a solid level of knowledge of software and web-based technology.
  Thus, the topic of this course is of interest to and accessible to
  students in a wide variety of specializations.
