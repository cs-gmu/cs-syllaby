<h1>Syllabus for SWE 781 001 (70704) / ISA 681 001 (75281) - Fall 2012</h1>

<p>
<i>As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. -- Maurice Wilkes (1949)<br><br></font></i>

<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
GMU Catalog:
"Theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular
on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows,
race conditions and random number generation, and on identification of
potential threats and vulnerabilities early in design cycle. Emphasizes
methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security
vulnerabilities, techniques to prove absence of vulnerabilities, ways
to avoid security holes in new software, and essential guidelines for
building secure software: how to design software with security in mind
from the ground up and integrate analysis and risk management throughout
the software life cycle."

<!--
<p>
This class will provide the theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows, race conditions and random number generation, and on the identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the design cycle. The emphasis is on methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security vulnerabilities, techniques to prove the absence of vulnerabilities, and ways to avoid security holes in new software and on essential guidelines for building secure software: how to design software with security in mind from the ground up and to integrate analysis and risk management throughout the software life cycle.
-->

<p>
People around the world now depend vitally on computers for their health
and well-being.
Unfortunately, vulnerabilities in their software can sometimes be exploited,
resulting in terrible harm.
This class will study how to prevent these vulnerabilities
from being in the software in the first place.
The goal of the class is to prepare you to be able to develop software
with far fewer security vulnerabilities than is typical today, and to
prepare you to help others do the same.

<p>
This is an extremely <i>practical</i> class.
We will cover principles, but we will also cover many specifics so you
can <i>apply</i> these principles in the real world.
If you cannot <i>apply</i> the theory,
you understand neither the theory nor the practice.
What's more, I want to have experience trying to convince others to
<i>change</i> their behavior to produce more secure software.

<p>
This classes focuses on defense, not on attack.
We'll discuss attack to some extent, but only enough to help us understand
how to defend.
Most software vulnerabilities are due to the same small set of weaknesses,
so we will spend a lot of time on understanding these common weaknesses
and how to counter them.
We will also cover general designs and techniques
for countering vulnerabilities in general.

<p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to write programs.
This is a practical class for developing programs, and you'll have a
programming project as part of the class.
<p>
You <i>must</i> be able to read and understand programs in both Java and C.
The principles are language-independent, but
I have to pick <i>some</i> languages so we can work out examples.
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Java and C
are the top two programming languages according to the
TIOBE programming community index for August 2012</a>, and
using both lets us examine a variety of real-world issues.
Some students have had success learning C simultaneously, but plan to
spend a lot of extra time if you plan to do that.
You'll need to be able to understand both Java and C code for
the mid-term exam, and I can't be a language tutor.

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>

<p>
The lectures will cover the key issues and
explain some things that might not be clear otherwise.
However, you are responsible for reading and understanding the material
in the assigned readings (and not just knowing what's in the lectures).
We meet Thursdays, Aug 30, 2012 - Dec 13, 2012, with a Thanksgiving
recess break Nov. 21-25.
We are not affected by the Columbus day recess.
Note that there is a significant amount of reading, especially
in the first half of the course; we then move into more specialized
topics and application.

<p>
<h1>Topic Paper/presentation</h1>
<p>
You must write a 4-5 page paper on a class-related topic and give
a matching 5-minute presentation to the class.
Everyone's topic <i>must</i> be different; first come, first served.
It <i>can</i> be something covered in class.
The paper needs at least two citations/references.
<p>
The topic paper and presentation
<i>must</i> present and plausibly <i>advocate</i> some specific actions
to take (or avoid) to produce more secure software.
For example:
<ol>
<li>
If your topic is a particular type of vulnerability,
explain what it is, but you must <i>also</i>
explain at least one way to counter that vulnerability
(more than one is fine; then briefly compare/contrast them).
If you fail to describe and advocate at least one specific approach
to avoid having these vulnerabilities,
you will <i>lose points</i>.
<li>
If your topic is the developing secure software in
a particular programming language, you need to describe
and advocate specific constructs to use/avoid (and explain why).
In these kinds of papers, just put in a sentence like
"The general principles of developing secure software apply to this
programming language; this paper describes some of the specific issues
in language XYZ", and then just focus on the key
issues specific to that language.
<li>
If your topic is a particular attack or security incident, you need to
give the "lessons learned" on <i>specific actions</i> a software developer
or manager should take or avoid, so that
that type of attack/incident would not be successful or as damaging.
</ol>
<p>
Everyone must give a brief 5-minute presentation to the class
on their topic.
This presentation must try to convince the listener
to do (or not do) something to produce more secure software.
We will all learn from these presentations, but that is not the only
reason I'm requiring presentations.
There is only one of me, and I cannot possibly teach everyone in the
world about secure software development.
However, if <i>you</i> can learn to change the behavior of others,
then together we can make a difference.
You must dress up when giving your topic presentation
(e.g., ties/slacks for gentlemen, skirts/dresses for ladies).
That may seem odd, but I am trying to approximate a
professional setting that may include technical managers
(who may control the budgets for doing or not doing something).
Being able to write secure code is vital, but being able to
convince others to change behavior is also vital
(especially if they control a budget!).
I want everyone to have the experience of advocating
to a group, in a simulated "professional" setting,
some action that you hope will improve software security.
It won't hurt, and that way, you'll be more prepared to do it in real life.
<p>
I do <i>not</i> expect the paper or presentation to be original research.
Instead, I expect you to summarize some specific topic,
organizing the information from multiple sources
into an understandable and <i>actionable</i> form.
You must, of course, cite your sources per the honor code.

<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and don't distract others.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate in class, and
if you use a laptop to take notes, please don't surf the net during class
(unless told otherwise).
Talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with class (especially the mid-term exam), e.g., a
<a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
GMU is an <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>
university; please see the University Catalog for
a full description of the code and the honor committee process. The
principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations
are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this
course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else's work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance
and clarification.
<b>Do not plagiarize.</b>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Students, please use your Mason email accounts to send and receive important
University information, including messages related to this class.
Please use the instructor's email address for class questions.
If GMU's email system messes up, that's GMU's problem; if outside
emails never get to GMU (or me), that's not GMU's (or my) problem.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
it's nice to let me know as a courtesy, but you must
contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations <i>must</i> be arranged through the ODS,
not through me.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me), please bring that <i>form</i> to me.
