<H2> Course Content</H2>
This course will teach fundamental programming principles with a focus on the mobile environment and the Android Platform. The course emphasizes practical application of numerous academic concepts.



This course is intended to be a project-based course. The introductory weeks focus on essentials needed to work on these projects. Students will complete multiple small labs and one final course project. Each student will design and implement an application for the final project. Course projects will be written in Java for the Android platform using the Android SDK.  
<P>
Designing applications for a mobile device present unique challenges. User interface, mobile-specific technologies, and the importance of performance require special consideration. The Android SDK has it's own interesting aspects to learn: the multi-touch model, accelerometer, important APIs will receive attention. Students will learn important development concepts applicable to any environment as well as Android specific APIs. Motorola Droid devices will be made available at various times throughout the semester to support application development & testing. 


<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
A C or better in both CS310 and CS367
<H2> Textbooks</H2>
There is no required text for this class.   Information about online resources will be provided to students.
<H2> Grading Policies</H2>

<b>Nominal Grading Scheme: This grading scheme assumes a good faith effort will be made by each student. The professor also reserves the right to modify the grading scheme as she deems appropriate.</b>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Exams: 50% (Final Exam & 2 Midterms)
<br>Students claiming an excused absence must apply in writing and furnish documentary support (such as from a health care professional who treated the student) for any assertion that the absence qualifies as an excused absence.  The support should explicitly indicate the dates and times the student was incapacitated due to illness and provide contact information for verification.  Self-documentation of illness is not sufficient support to excuse an absence. 


 <li> Programming Project & Labs: 50%
<br>There will be weekly labs and team projects assigned. There will be both coding and documentation requirements in the project.  The project will have checkpoints at which material will be due for grading before the final due date of the finished project.
</ul>


<H2> Honor Code</H2>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts. Information on the university honor code
can be found at:

<P>
This semester I will probably be using similarity detection software to 
assist me in finding honor code violations, should they occur.
