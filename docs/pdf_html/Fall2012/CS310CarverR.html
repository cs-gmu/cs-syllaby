<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Prerequisite</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">The prerequisite for this course is C or
better in CS 211.  Students are expected to have a significant degree of skill in
programming (program organization, coding, documenting, testing and
debugging).  Students should be acquainted with basic complexity analysis ("big
O") and be able to build abstract data types using Java classes.
</font></p>

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Course Description</font></h3>
<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">CS 310 continues the study of data structures from CS 211.
Students will learn how to approach larger and more challenging programming projects
than the projectsin CS 211.  Programming is a significant part of this course
and students should expect to spend a good deal of time on the programming
projects.
</font></p>
<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">
<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Course Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li> Reinforce what students learned about elementary data structures from CS 211</li>
<li> Extend student knowledge of data structures to more sophisticated data structures. This
includes balanced binary search trees, B-trees and B+-trees, hashing, and basic graphs.</li>
<li> Use generic types in their data structures.</li>
<li> Do more demanding programming than they did in CS 211. All programming is done
in Java. This involves more program design and debugging techniques.</li>
</font></ul></p>
<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Topics</font></h3>

<ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1"><li>Generic types</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Stacks and queues</li>
<li>Binary trees</li>
<li>Balanced binary trees</li>
<li>Multi-way trees</li>
<li>B-trees and B+-trees</li>
<li>File organization</li>
<li>Set and Map representations</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
</font></ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1">This list is subject to change as interest evolves.

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Programs</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">There will be several programming assignments.  
Programming assignments will be posted on the course website.
<p>
You can only turn in a program <i>once</i>.  No revisions or additions
can be made to your program after it has been submitted.  Late
programs will be accepted with a 10% per day late penalty.  You
are responsible for keeping backups of your work.
</font></p>

<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Honor Code</font></h3>
<p>
Read the CS Department honor
code: <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">
http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies</a>
and the University honor code: <a href="http://honorcode.gmu.edu/">
http://honorcode.gmu.edu</a>.  You are bound by these honor codes.  
Any submitted work
which shows too much commonality with others' work to be completely
original, or any plagiarized work, will receive a grade of 0.  Any
code which is presented in class or provided to you as part of the
project may be included in your programs.
</font></p>



<h3><font face="serif" size="+1">Grading</font></h3>

<p>
<font face="serif" size="+1">There will be a midterm exam and a final.  There 
will be no makeups on exams except under exceptional circumstances, and any such 
makeup <i>must</i> be arranged in advanced.  Grades will 
computed from a weighted average computed with the following weights:
</font></p>

<ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1"><li>programs + homework: 40%</li>
<li>midterm exam: 30%</li>

<li>final exam: 30%</li>

</font></ul>
<font face="serif" size="+1">
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic
accommodations, please see me and contact the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) at 993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through the
ODS.
