<h1>Computer Science CS 777 / 001</h1>
<h2>Human Computer
  Intelligent Interaction</h2>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> Wednesday, 7:20 pm - 10:00 pm, in Innovation Hall 136

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>

<p><h3>About the Class</h3>
Current and emerging issues in human-computer intelligent interaction
and human-centered systems and their applications. In the beginning of
the semester the instructor will discuss the current state of the
art. 
After that we will focus on selected topics in human-computer
intelligent interaction. Topics include:
<p>
<dl>
<dd> video processing
<dd> visualization
<dd> virtual environments
<dd> adaptation and tutoring
<dd> image and scene modeling
<dd> analysis and synthesis
<dd> face and gesture recognition
<dd> speech and natural language processing.
</dl> 
In this part we will use optional text and selected papers published in various conferences and journals. The presentations will be done by the students.

<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<dl>
  <dd> Artificial Intelligence
<dd> Computer Graphics
