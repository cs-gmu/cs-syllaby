					<strong>Course Outcomes</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					CS 321 gives an introduction to principles and techniques used in software engineering: <br>
					<ul>
						<li>An understanding of all phases of the software engineering lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance).</li>
						<li>An understanding of several software lifecycle models including both prescriptive and agile models and knowledge of tradeoffs among these models.</li>
						<li>An ability to create and use UML models to develop and document software analysis and design artifacts.</li>
						<li>An understanding of fundamental project management and leadership issues for software teams.</li>
						<li>An ability to apply software engineering methods to address the requirements and design phases of a large software project.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					CS 321 will have a software engineering project that requires student to participate in working teams where students organize, manage, and practice a software engineering project. This will be a design project with some prototype implementation. See the <b><a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~kdobolyi/cs321/project.html">project page</a></b> for more details.<br>
					<br>
					CS 321 includes Writing Intensive (WI) activities that, together with those of CS 306, meet the GMU WI Requirements in the BS CS Program (http://wac.gmu.edu). This means you will write 1750 graded words (or about 7 standard pages). You will get feedback on this writing, and be able to resubmit revisions based on the feedback. For this course, part of the writing will include an individual essay on your experiences working with your team.

					<strong>Grading</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Quizzes (20%)</li>
						<li>In-class assignments (5%)</li>
						<li>Project assignments (40%)</li>
						<li>Essay (10%)</li>
						<li>Final Exam (25%)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					Final course grades are calculated as follows:<br>
					<br>
     				A+ (>= 98.0%) A (>= 92.0%) A&ndash; (>= 90.0%)<br>
					B+ (>= 88.0%) B (>= 82.0%) B&ndash; (>= 80.0%)<br>
     				C+ (>= 78.0%) C (>= 72.0%) C&ndash; (>= 70.0%)<br>
					D  (>= 60.0%)<br>
					F  (< 60.0%)<br>
					<br>
					Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam meeting.<br>
					<br>
					Group members must participate equally in project assignments; the professor reserves the right to assign a zero to any student
					for any deliverable retroactively, if it turns out that nothing of academic merit was contributed to the assignment by any 
					individual. It is up to students to prove their participation on deliverables, and the professor will examine ONLY svn logs in the event
					of any disputes of participation. Make sure you are using svn, and using it through your login.

					<strong>Class Participation</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					<font color=red>This course uses a flipped classroom approach.</font><br><br>
					I have provided links to content on Youtube as a supplement to materials. The linked content is not owned by me, nor was it 
					created by me, therefore I don't have any rights or control over what exists in the videos - view them at your own risk. Having
					said that, these are the popular and useful videos I found on Youtube for various lecture topics. Feel free to look for ones on
					your own, or let me know if you found a better one than anything I linked. If you do not want to view the videos, you do not have to; the slides contain all
					the information you're responsible for for quizzes, and the in-class exercises will allow you to practice the material and
					ask questions.<br><br>
					Students are expected to attend and actively engage in lectures. Most lectures will involve completing reading assignments
					at home and being prepared to take a quiz in class. Lectures are also used to solve in-class examples and 
					work on the semester project. Lectures will not generally be used to introduce or review material, as that should be done
					in reading (or watching videos) at home. <br>
					<br>
					Groupwork will make up a large part of the students' grades. Students are expected to participate equally and fully in group assignments.
					Each deliverable will require students to complete the deliverable all, or in part, individually at first. The instructors will 
					examine these individual assignments and adjust points for groupwork if students are found to not contribute adequately to 
					draft deliverables.

					<strong>Late Policy</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					All assignments must be received by the deadline (submitted on Blackboard by 11:55pm on the date due if not otherwise noted). No late assignments will be accepted. 
					All project assignments must be submitted online, through your team's repository, by 11:55pm on the day they are due.

					<strong>Exams</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by instructor. Appropriate documentation (as determined by instructor) and requisite permissions are required for make-up exam requests. Picture IDs are required to take all exams.<br>
					If you know in advance that you are unable to make an exam for a valid and unavoidable reason (such as a scheduled surgery, etc), you must notify the professor at least one week before the scheduled exam date to make arrangements for a make-up, and bring documentation with you when you take the make-up. If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam. Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a zero.<br>
					You must take the final exam for the section that you are registered for.

					<strong>Honor Code</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					All students are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>. This policy is rigorously enforced. All class-related assignments are considered individual efforts unless explicitly expressed otherwise (in writing). Review the university honor code and present any questions regarding the policies to instructor. <br>
					Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code.<br>
