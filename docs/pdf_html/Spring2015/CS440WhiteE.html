Course Content</H2>
This course will cover the theoretical and implementation aspects of language
processing. Emphasis will be on the design and construction of compilers.
There are several <b>substantial</b> programming assignments associated with this
course.

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<oL>
 
<li>Be able to compare compiled and interpreted execution models, outlining the relative merits of each	   
<li> Be able to describe the phases of program translation from source code to executable code and the files produced by these phases	   
<li> Be able to write regular expressions and finite state automata for languages, be able to use tools to automatically generate scanners.	   
<li> Understand the definition of grammars; be able to write grammar for context-free languages; be able to manually write recursive-descent parsers; be able to transform grammars and use automatic tools to generate bottom-up parsers.	   
<li> Be able to construct and maintain symbol table; be able to process declarations and scopes; understand the type system and type checking.	   
<li> Be able to describe the storage system and explain the implementation of high-level language features like function calls.	   
<li> Be able to explain the major problems and solutions of code generation; be able to implement code generator from intermediate code.	   
<li> Be able to explain important optimization schemes; be able to describe and apply data-flow analysis.

Grading Policies</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
There will be 3 programming assignments, together worth 50% (15 + 15 + 20) of your grade.
These are to be <B>individual</B> efforts, meaning no sharing of code or
discussion of problem solution allowed with anyone but me or the TA.  Late programming assignments
will be penalized 20% for each day late.
<li> Homework (10% of your grade) will be assigned periodically.  Homework may be done individually or in groups.  Late homework will
be accepted with the following penalties: 1 day = 10%, 2 days = 30%, 3 days = 60%, 4 days = not accepted
<LI>
There will be two exams during the semester, each worth 20% of your grade.</LI>

All exams are closed book. 
You must have a written
excuse (doctor's note, for example) to miss an exam. I reserve the right
to give oral makeup exams in lieu of written.</LI>

<LI>
It has been my experience that time is the biggest determiner of your final
grade in this class. I suggest that you start assignments when I hand them
out. They often take more time than you think.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Honor Code</H2>
You are expected to abide by the honor code. Programming assignments and
exams are individual efforts. Information on the university honor code
can be found in the <A HREF="http://oai.gmu.edu/honor-code/">here.</A></TT>
<P>
This semester I will probably be using similarity detection software to 
assist me in finding honor code violations, should they occur.

<H2>Disability Services</h2>
The <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">Office of Disability Services </a>(ODS) is available to serve all students with disabilities, including those with cognitive (e.g., learning, psychological, and closed head injury), sensory, mobility, and other physical impairments.
