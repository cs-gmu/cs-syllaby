    </ul>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Programming projects will be a primary focus of your grade - each
      one should take multiple sessions of coding, with questions asked
      in between. This is the practice you need to learn, master, and
      internalize various concepts of the course.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>All programming project must run on Marmoset to be
          considered for credit. All projects will be automatically
          graded on Marmoset. See the <a
            href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/%7Ekdobolyi/cs112/marmoset.html">Marmoset





            submission instructions</a>. Under no circumstances will
          credit be given for a project, except through Marmoset.</li>
        <li>Note that Marmoset accepts multiple assignment submissions;
          we will grade the submission with the highest score. You can
          also download your previous submissions from Marmoset to
          verify that you turned in a working copy.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Deadline</h2>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>All programming projects must be submitted by the deadline
          to be considered for full credit. Projects that are up to <b>one





            day late</b> will be tolerated, but are subject to a <b>penalty




            of 20%</b>. No assignment will be accepted for credit after
          last class meeting.</li>
        <li>Marmoset being unavailable is not an excuse for turning in a
          late assignment; in the rare situation that the website is
          somehow unavailable or giving the student an error, the
          student MUST email their submission to their GTA before the
          deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
        <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
          extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
          service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever
          it takes. Every semester multiple students' computers die, are
          stolen, or otherwise 'lose' projects. Don't be the student who
          forgot to (frequently) back up your work!</li>
        <li>Note that Marmoset accepts multiple assignment submissions;
          we will grade the submission with the highest score. You can
          also download your previous submissions from Marmoset.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Office hours</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>For students seeking help with programming assignments
          during office hours, students must identify the line number,
          through debug print statements, where they believe an error to
          be before seeing the TA or instructor. This implies that you
          must have your own test cases, at least one of which that
          fails, to bring to office hours before the TAs or instructor
          can help you.<br>
        </li>
        <li>For more general programming assignment questions, students
          must bring their own pseudocode to office hours before the TA
          or professor can help you.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Under no circumstances will the professor or GTA reveal more
          than three lines of code at a time during office hours.
          Students must make significant, individual effort on all
          projects before coming to see a GTA/professor. Waiting until
          the last minute, in the expectations that the entire project
          will be explained in one office hours session, is not
          feasible.</li>
        <li>Office hours are often crowded - do not rely on them for
          last minute help, as we cannot guarantee that we will be able
          to spend significant time with every student. Use the
          discussion board instead for posting questions.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Discussion board</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The discussion board on Piazza is required reading for
            all projects</b>. Although every effort is made to post
          complete and consistent project specifications, because
          projects are designed from scratch every semester, it is
          inevitable that specs will change slightly throughout the
          semester. You MUST read the discussion board daily for
          clarifications and project updates, and you MUST be prepared
          to implement these small potential changes.</li>
        <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, Piazza,
          to ask and answer questions. Responses to questions can be
          expected within 24 hours, and often times much sooner (within
          two hours or less during the day). <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Under no circumstances should code be posted publicly to
            the discussion board.</b> Students can post questions and
          code privately, although the instructor reserves the right to
          make any post public, so that other students can see the
          responses. <br>
        </li>
        <li>For students wishing to post their code privately to Piazza,
          the same rules apply as when coming to office hours; if you
          have code written, you must produce at least one failing test
          case where you have identified what line number is giving you
          problems.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Honor code</h2>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming projects are considered individual efforts,
          therefore no sharing of code and/or discussion of problem
          solutions are allowed with anyone except the lab GTA, UTA or
          the professor. Test cases must also not be shared. Student
          projects will be manually and automatically assessed for
          cheating. <b><font color="#cc0000">You may not look at or
              otherwise view any other individual's code, pseudocode, or
              test cases.</font></b><br>
        </li>
        <li>You may not use any Internet resources to create code or
          algorithms, besides the textbooks, the slides, and Piazza,
          unless otherwise specified. However, you are free to look up
          the syntax errors your encounter online, to gain an
          understanding of what the syntax error means. The projects
          we're doing this semester can be directly solved using
          techniques discussed in class, and no outside material is
          needed unless otherwise noted.</li>
        <li><b>It is your responsibility</b> to lock your computers with
          a password, to not post your code to websites like Pastebin
          that are publicly accessible, to guard your USB drives and
          computers, to not upload your files to someone else's
          computer, etc. You will be liable for any access gained to
          your code. Stating that "I don't know how he/she got access to
          my code", or "I left the room and they stole my code" are not
          an acceptable excuses in an honor code violation.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lab assessment<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly lab assessment may include quzzies and/or coding
        assignments.</li>
      <li><b>We will drop your lowest lab grade</b>.</li>
      <li>Any missed lab assessment is simply missed, regardless of the
        reason why (travel, illness, work, traffic, receiving a major
        award, getting married, saving the universe, etc.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by
        instructor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>They will be entirely paper and pencil - no computers.</li>
      <li>All students must have their GMU identification available on
        testing days<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you know in advance that you are unable to make an exam for
        a valid and unavoidable reason (such as a scheduled surgery,
        etc), you must notify the professor at least one week before the
        scheduled exam date to make arrangements for a make-up, and
        bring documentation with you when you take the make-up. <br>
      </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero. We may also elect to allow the final exam to count the
        extra amount to give you a sort of do-over. </li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Per departmental policy, a failing grade on the final exam
        (&lt;60.0%) will result in a failing grade (F) for the entire
        course, regardless of performance on other assignments. <b>You
          must pass the final exam to pass the course.</b> <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested
        within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be
        considered subsequent to that deadline, or after the final exam
        meeting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><br>
    </h1>
    <h1>3 <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font></h1>
    <p>All students are expected to abide by the <a
        href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
      This policy is rigorously enforced. All class-related assignments
      are considered individual efforts unless explicitly expressed
      otherwise (in writing). Cheating on any assignment will be
      prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee as
      outlined in the GMU Honor Code. Sharing, collaboration, or looking
      at any code or algorithm related to programming assignments that
      is not your own is considered cheating.<br>
      <br>
      The computer science department has an additional, more
      restrictive <a
        href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/CSHonorCodePolicies">CS







        Honor Code</a> that you are also subject to. Make sure you read
      and familiarize yourself with these rules. We use automated
      software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to
      find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
      Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than
      a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.
      Confirmed cases of cheating almost always translate into course
      failure.<br>

    <h1>4 Learning Disabilities</h1>
    <p>Students with a learning disability or other condition
      (documented with GMU's <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">Office of
        Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance
      should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss appropriate
      accommodations. <br>
