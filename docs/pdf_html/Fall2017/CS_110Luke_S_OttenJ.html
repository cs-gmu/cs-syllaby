<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3> None.  Enrollment in the course is limited to students in the BS Applied Computer Science or BS Computer Science programs.

<h3>Textbook and Readings</h3>
<a href="http://sci.informatik.uni-kl.de/rechnerzugang/unix/unix_book.pdf">Introduction
          to Unix by Fiamingo, DeBula, Condron</a>, available online for free.  	Additional assigned readings of webpages and other materials will be given as the course progresses.

<h3>Computing Resources</h3>
 Students must have access to a computer and have the ability to install software and operating systems on it.Â  If a student anticipates difficulty accessing a suitable environment, contact your instructor.
          

<h3>Course Description</h3>This course provides a baseline knowledge of
    technical and social issues at the heart of computer science. No prior
    knowledge of computing is assumed. Students will develop a basic
    understanding of simple algorithms, information representation, and styles
    of problem solving which strongly affect computer science. They will gain
    practical experience working with a Unix-like operating system. Data
    security will be discussed to ensure safe communication. Students will gain
    exposure to basic software development tools such as version control, text
    editors, and shell scripting. A variety of social and ethical issues will be
    discussed throughout the course including information ownership and the
    impact of computing on society. Guest lectures from active computer science
    researchers will give students some exposure to cutting-edge problems in the
    field.


 
<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be divided roughly as follows:

<span class="list">45%</span> Homework assignments,
 
<span class="list">10%</span> Class participation, group assignments, and instructor evaluation,

<span class="list">45%</span> Exams.

<p>In addition, in order to receive a passing grade in this class, each student
    will also meet at least once with their academic advisor during the
    semester.


<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
Assignments turned in after the due date will be
    penalized 10 percent per day (including weekends and holidays). You are permitted to submit early and to do so multiple times: only the last submission will be graded.  Resubmissions after the deadline will require prior (before the deadline) approval of your TA. No resubmissions may be made after an assignment has been graded.
    
<h3>Class Communications</h3>
CS 110 will be using Piazza and
    Blackboard for most class communications. You are responsible for any
    notifications or information posted on Blackboard/Piazza either by your
    instructor, your GTA or the class UTA(s), and you will need to check the
    systems regularly for such notices. Some information may be disseminated
    through these systems rather than in class. Individual communications with
    the professor/GTA/UTA may be done by email using your GMU email account.
    When you email, please be sure to include your name, the class number and
    the topic in the subject header. (E.g.: Subject: Jim Jones / CS 110-003 /
    Homework 2)


<h3>Disabilities</h3>
If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to us about accommodations.
 
<h3>Absences and Participation Credit</h3>
Any absences from class for
    health or emergency reasons are excused only if reasonable, official notice is
    provided.
    
<h3>Honor Code</h3>
All students are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/full-honor-code-document/">GMU Honor Code</a>.      The computer science department has a <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">specific interpretation of the Honor Code for computer science majors</a> that you are subject to.  
Honor code policies are rigorously enforced.  Unless otherwise specified, all
    class-related assignments are to be individual efforts.  Certain portions of
    group assignments may require individual efforts as well.   Be careful
    to follow instructions regarding acceptable group efforts.   Plagiarism, copying code, unauthorized collaboration, looking at other assignments that are not your own, and other forms of cheating
    on any assignment will result in a notification of the
    Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor Code.   Feel free to ask the instructors for any clarification.

<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>

Students will:

<ul>
<li>Understand how information can be represented with bits and how those bits may be interpreted and modified in different ways including as numbers, text, images, sound, and combinations thereof.
<p><li>Gain familiarity with the Unix operating system including file storage, tools to manipulate files and their contents, and basic scripting facilities to automate tasks.
<p><li>Understand basic computer networking and security precautions to take while working with networked devices.
<p><li>Gain familiarity with program development tools including IDEs, non-graphical editors, and revision control software.
<p><li>Gain experience reading technical documentation associated with computing tools and programming concepts.
<p><li>Understand appropriate use of technology and information in the computer science discipline and in broader contexts.
<p><li>Gain familiarity with some sub-fields of computer science which demonstrate the field beyond programming.
<p><li>Understand how computing and automation continue to impact human society.
</ul>

<h3>MASON Core Ethics Learning Outcomes</h3>

<!--This course is intended to meet the IT Ethics
    component of the Mason Core Requirements. To do this, it will address the
    following outcomes:<br>-->
    
    
    This course is intended to meet the IT Ethics component of the Mason core Requirements (pending approval from the GMU Core Committee).  To do this, it will address the following outcomes:
    
    <ul>
      <li>IT Outcome #3: <i>Students will understand many of the key ethical, legal and social issues related to information technology and how to interpret and comply with ethical principles, laws, regulations, and institutional policies. </i>
      
      <p>This will be
        met through class discussions related to ethical theories and social
        implications of current computing trends such as Artificial
        Intelligence, Software Reliability, Responsible Computing, and use of online resources. Several class
        assignments will also address these topics.
        
    <p><li>IT Outcome #5: <i>Students will understand the essential issues related to information security, how to take precautions and use techniques and tools to defend against computer crimes.</i> 
    
    <p>This
        outcome will be met by class lectures on encryption, security, student use of
        secure communication channels (i.e. Virtual Private Networks), and an
        assignment on the modification of software security settings.</li>
 </ul>
    
<!--
    The course will also meet the following IT core requirement:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>IT Outcome #1: <i><b>Students will understand the core IT concepts in
            a range of current and emerging technologies and learn to apply
            appropriate technologies to a range of tasks.</b></i> This outcome
        will be met through class lectures related to the underlying
        representation of data by computers, problem solving and algorithm
        development, Unix, and programming tools. Students will also be given
        assignments relating to these topics.</li>
    </ul>
