      <li>D (&gt;= 60.0%)</li>
      <li>F (&lt; 60.0%)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Homework assignments will require some programming. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Homework assignments must be done on an individual basis
        unless stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Please ensure that the assignments are submitted on-time to
        Blackboard. <font color="#ff6600"><b>No late submission
            accepted!</b></font><br>
      </li>
      <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
        extension. Use a backup service such as DropBox (or any cloud
        service), emailing yourself, storing to a USB drive, whatever it
        takes. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exams are closed book/notes unless specified otherwise by
        instructor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>They will be entirely paper and pencil - no computers.</li>
      <li>All students must have their GMU identification available on
        testing days.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you know in advance that you are unable to make an exam for
        a valid and unavoidable reason (such as a scheduled surgery,
        etc), you must notify the professor at least one week before the
        scheduled exam date to make arrangements for a make-up, and
        bring documentation with you when you take the make-up. <br>
      </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero. We may also elect to allow the final exam to count the
        extra amount to give you a sort of do-over. </li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Attendance is not compulsory but highly recommended for doing
        well in the class. <br>
      </li>
      <li>In-class exercises/quizzes require classroom attendance.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Discussion board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, Piazza,
        to ask and answer questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>No sharing answers to homework assignments on the discussion
        board.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Under no circumstances should code be posted publicly to the
        discussion board. Students can post questions and code
        privately, although the instructor reserves the right to make
        any post public, so that other students can see the responses. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Contesting of grades on any/all submissions must be requested
        within one week of the item's return. No grade changes will be
        considered subsequent to that deadline.</li>
      <li>IN (Incomplete) policy as indicated in the catalog will be
        strictly adhered to. You must provide the necessary back-up
        documentation (e.g. medical certificate) for your application to
        be considered favorably. In all circumstances, the written
        request, with all the back up documentation, must be received
        before the final exam week.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><br>
    </h1>
    <h1>3 <font color="#cc0000">Honor Code</font></h1>
    <p>All students are expected to abide by the <a
        href="http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
      This policy is rigorously enforced. The computer science
      department has an <a
        href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
        Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our course<b>.&nbsp;



      </b>Cheating on any assignment will be prosecuted and result in a
      notification of the Honor Committee as outlined in the GMU Honor
      Code. Sharing, collaboration, or looking at any code, algorithm,
      or solutions of assignments that is not your own (or outside the
      group for group assignments) is considered cheating.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>4 Learning Disabilities</h1>
    <p>Students with a learning disability or other condition
      (documented with GMU's <a href="http://ds.gmu.edu">Office of
        Disability Services</a>) that may impact academic performance
      should speak with the professor ASAP to discuss appropriate
      accommodations. <br>
