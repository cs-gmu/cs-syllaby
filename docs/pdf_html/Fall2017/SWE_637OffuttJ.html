<b>Description</b>:
   Concepts and techniques for testing software and assuring its quality.
   Topics cover software testing at the unit, module, subsystem, and system levels,
   automatic and manual techniques for generating and validating test data,
   the testing process, static vs. dynamic analysis, functional testing,
   inspections, and reliability assessment.

<p>
   Professor's note: The course will attempt to prepare students to test software in structured,
   organized ways.
   This course should provide practical knowledge of a variety of ways to test software
   an understanding of some of the tradeoffs between testing techniques
   and a feel for the practice of software testing and  the research in software testing.
