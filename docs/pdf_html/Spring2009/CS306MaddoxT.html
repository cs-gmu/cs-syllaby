             <b></b>            
<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is intended to help students become
      effective professionals in the field of computer science by examining
  many    of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer
 technology    and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those
 challenges.     Students will examine the philosophical bases for ethical
 decision-making    and how to apply them to issues raised by computers and
 technology.  Specific    topics covered in CS 105, such as intellectual
property   concerns and software    liability issues, will be addressed by
this course  in a more intensive manner.  Emerging legal and ethical issues
involved in  the computer profession and   e-commerce will also be addressed.
</p>
                         
<p>Students will investigate the role of ethics for the computer professional
      in various situations through individual and group work. Students should
     be prepared to participate during class activities and to interact with
   their   classmates. Students will refine their personal points of view
on   various   ethical issues and consider how such issues - and their own
views   - impact   on professional colleagues, clients and the general public.
