    <li> For Projects and Recitations: Contact Your Recitation GTA </li>
    <ul>
      <li> If you are unable to come to a resolution with your GTA, please contact Prof. Andrea </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Grading Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> There are no make-up projects, quizzes, recitations, or exams. </li>
    <li> There are no additional extra-credit assignments. </li>
    <li> There are no points associated with unused late-tokens. </li>
    <li> There is no course-long curve at the end of the semester. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Blackboard Submission must be made by the <b>Project Due Date</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>No Project is Accepted more than 48-hours after the Project Due Date.</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>You may only use up to 2 of your total Late Tokens for a single Project.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Your code must compile and run on Zeus to be graded.</li>
      <ul>
        </li>If your code does not compile on Zeus, it cannot be graded.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Check your submission to make sure it is the correct files!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files will likely result in a <b>zero</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Back up your work!
      <ul>
        <li>Catastrophic computer/file failure or corruption will not be cause for an extension.</li>
        <li>Do not put your code in any public repository where others can find it.</li>
        <li>You may use private repositories (github has a private mode).</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Late Tokens:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone starts with 3 Late Tokens total for all Projects during the Semester.</li>
      <li>Each Late Token adds 24 hours to the Deadline of a Project.</li>
      <li>Late Tokens are <b>Automatically Used</b> when you submit Late.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You don't need to tell your GTA, they will deduct Late Tokens based on Submission Time.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>You may only use up to 2 of your total Late Tokens for a single Project.</b></li>
      <li>Unused Tokens have no Grade Value at the end of the semester.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Late Work (No Tokens Remaining):</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>You may only submit up to 48 hours after the Official Deadline of the Project.</li>
      <li>If you run out of Late Tokens, each additional day late will have a grade penalty.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For every late day without a token, a 25% Ceiling Pentalty will be Applied</li>
        <li>So, for one day late without a token, your max possible score will be a 75%.</li>
        <li>And for two days late without tokens, your max possible score willbe a 50%.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

</div><div id=spacer></div>

<!--[ZEUS]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=zeus class=main>
  <h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>Systems Programming</b> class.  Unlike CS 262 or CS 222, which are general-purpose C courses for any computer system, this course is based on building programs for a specific system.  For CS 367, that system is Zeus. </p>

  <p>Zeus is a Linux computer running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is administerd by the College of Engineering and Computing for our use.  Some of our programs will involve libraries that have been pre-built on Zeus, and some programs will use system specific features that may only build properly on Zeus.</p>

  <h3>Connecting to Zeus</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Instructions for Zeus and for setting up the VPN: <a href="https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems/Zeus">https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems/Zeus</a> </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Zeus Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>All Projects must Compile and Run on Zeus</b> </li>
    <li> All Projects will be Tested and Graded only on Zeus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> You may develop wherever and using whichever tools you like. </li>
      <li> You will need to ensure your work builds and runs on Zeus before submission. </li>
      <li> A project that will not compile on Zeus cannot be graded. </li>
      <li> Remember, C has certain guarantees and others that are only 'system dependent'. It still needs to run properly on Zeus to be graded. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> You will need to set up the Campus VPN to access Zeus from off-campus. </li>
  </ul>

<!--[HONOR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=honor class=main>
  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  <p>The honor code at George Mason is an important part of our academic culture. A degree from this institution should be a direct measure of your own progress and abilities, and as such at all times we must ensure that all work that should be your own is your own.</p>

  <p>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to compare your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity. Repeat to yourself: it's not worth trying to cheat. We will catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.</p>

  <p><b>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The usual recommendation is failure in the course.</b></li>
    <li>It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a semester and lose some implicated friends; please don't put yourself through that experience!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><b>Honor Code Policies</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to use code from the Internet.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes Stackoverflow, Chegg, Github, ReplIt, TutorialPoint,  or any other site with code.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to discuss any implementation (code) or design decisions with any other student.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes prior students and students from other sections.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You are not allowed to share or use any code from any other student (including past students)</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This includes posting your code to a public GitHub repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>


  <h3><b>Honor Code Responsibilities</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>It is your responsibility to ...</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> lock your computers with a password,</li>
      <li> not post your code to websites like Pastebin or ReplIt that are publicly accessible,</li>
      <li> not post code to any public repositories,</li>
      <li> (If you use services like Github/Gitlab) make sure your repo is set private.</li>
      <li>  guard your USB drives and computers,</li>
      <li>  not upload your files to someone else's computer, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>You will be liable for any access gained to your public or unprotected code.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> If you are in a team with other students for another class, ensure CS 367 files are protected.</li>
      <li> Make sure none of your work is possible to access by any other student.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>UTAs and GTAs are allowed to help you in your Projects!  But there are some limitations.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>TAs can help you with designing data structures, the overall algorithm used, C programming in general, and fixing any bugs.</li>
      <li>TAs can not give you code, allow you to copy code from someone else, or help you write your code.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3><b>Honor Code Links and Specifics</b></h3>

  <p>All course materials posted to Blackboard or other course site are private; by federal law, any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice, or image) must not be shared with anyone not enrolled in this class.</p>

  <p>To protect your privacy, I also cannot list your GMU email address on any public forum or provide it to any other students. You may, of course, give your email address to any other students.</p>

  <p>Video recordings of class meetings that are shared only with the instructors and students officially enrolled in a class do not violate FERPA or any other privacy expectation.</p>
  <b>My own Personal Privacy Statements</b>
  <ul>
    <li>If we ever do have to have an online session (eg. Snow Day), I will <b>Never</b> require anyone to have any cameras/webcams active.</li>
    <li>I believe that requiring any video from you for an online lecture is an invasion of your personal privacy and of your space.</li>
    <li>I will never require or even allow the use of any video cameras.</li>
    <li>Others may have different policies, and that's for them to decide on the best policies for their own courses.  This is simply my own personal policy.</li>

<!--[Disability]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=disability class=main>
  <h2>Disability Services</h2>
  Students with a disability or other condition (documented with GMU's Office of Disability Services) that may impact academic performance should speak with the professor as soon as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations.<br><br>

  If you are in a situation that even <b>temporarily</b> affects your ability to learn or work, such as with a broken limb or other such injury, contact the Office of Disability Services to get accommodations.<br><br>

  We are quite happy to assist as is appropriate, but it must be documented ahead of time by ODS. <br><br>

  <b>Policies</b>
  <ul>
    <li> Bringing the paperwork with you to a scheduled exam or at the deadline for a project or an assigned quiz is far too late!</li>
