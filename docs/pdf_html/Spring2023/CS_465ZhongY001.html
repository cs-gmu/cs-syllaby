    <h2>2.2 Homework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Homework assignments might require some programming. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Homework assignments must be done on an individual basis
        unless stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>All assignment grades are normalized and each contributes to
        your final grade evenly. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Incorrect/broken submissions: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Turning in the wrong files or corrupted files will likely
          result in a zero. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Code that doesn't compile/assemble/run will likely get a
          very low score. </li>
        <li>If you turn in the wrong files, the ONLY way you MIGHT
          receive credit is by showing your professor a backup where the
          modified date on the files is<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>outside of
            your control</b>. Modified dates on personal computers
          and/or public computers are<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>NEVER</i><span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>accepted as proof
          of work. Backups which WILL ALWAYS be considered are: backup
          copy on zeus; prior submissions to Gradescope/Blackboard; or
          emails to your Professor/GTA. Backups which MIGHT be accepted
          include: emails from your GMU email to yourself, uploading to
          certain backup services (such as OneDrive or a <u>private</u>
          GitHub repo), and uploads to the discussion forum.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>: </font></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Homework can be turned in <b>at most 24 hours</b> late, no
          exceptions.</li>
        <li>Submitting an assignment late
          <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
            charset=UTF-8">
          incurs a <b>25%</b> ceiling penalty so that RecordedGrade =
          min(75%, RawGrade).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Each student gets <b>two</b> "Emergency Day" tokens, which
          are <i>automatically</i> used by late submissions to avoid
          the 25% penalty. <u>Only one token can be applied to each
            assignment</u><u>.</u> </li>
        <li>Unused emergency-tokens will be worth 0.25% bonus to a
          student's overall grade at the semester's end.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Blackboard/Gradescope being unavailable is not an excuse for
          turning in a late assignment; in the rare situation that the
          website is somehow unavailable or giving the student an error,
          the student MUST email their submission to their Professor/GTA
          before the deadline, otherwise it will be considered late.</li>
        <li>Catastrophic computer failure will not be cause for an
          extension. Use a backup service such as OneDrive (or any cloud
          service), emailing yourself, making multiple rounds of
          submissions to Blackboard/Gradescope, whatever it takes. <br>

    <h2>2.3 Quizzes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be weekly online quizzes on Blackboard for most of
        the weeks.</li>
      <li>The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</li>
      <li><font color="#ff6600"><b>Late Policy</b>:</font> <b>no late

    <h2>2.4 Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be in-class exercises and grading will be based on
        <b>participation</b>.</li>
      <li>The lowest exercise grade will be dropped.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>2.5 Exams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exams are closed book unless specified otherwise by the
        instructor.&nbsp; They will be entirely paper and pencil - no
        computers.</li>
      <li>All students must have their GMU identification available on
        testing days.</li>
      <li>Early or Late/Makeup Exams require exceptional circumstances
        (as judged by the professor) and must be arranged in advance.
        Vacation plans are not exceptional circumstances.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        Missing an exam due for any non-university-accepted reason (such
        as not paying attention to when the exam is), will result in a
        zero. </li>
      <li>If you miss an exam due to a university-accepted excused
        absence (such as an illness or car accident the day and time of
        the exam), you must notify your professor within 24 hours of
        your absence to make arrangements for a makeup, and bring
        approved documentation with you when you take the make-up exam.
        Failure to follow either of these policies will result in a
        zero.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        We may elect to replace a missed midterm with some (or all) of
        the final exam grade rather than offering a makeup exam. </li>
      <li>We reserve the right to give oral makeup exams in lieu of
        written. </li>
      <li>The final will not be given early. You are starting the course
        with knowledge of the schedule (see GMU's Final Exam Calendar
        for the latest schedule, updated as weather events require).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.6 Discussion Board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students are encouraged to use the discussion board, <b>Piazza</b>,
        to ask and answer questions.&nbsp; <i>Link/access code to
          Piazza will be available on Blackboard</i>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>No sharing answers to homework assignments on the discussion
        board.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Under no circumstances should your code of assignments be
        posted publicly to the discussion board. Students can post
        questions and code privately, although the instructor reserves
        the right to make any post public, so that other students can
        see the responses. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.7 Other<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Contested Grades</b>: Contesting of grades on any/all
        submissions must be requested within one week of receiving the
        grade. No grade changes will be considered subsequent to that
        deadline.</li>
      <li>There will be no make-up or extra-credit assignments at the
        end of the semester; your grade should be a measure of your
        semester-long progress.<br>
      </li>
      <li>IN (Incomplete) policy as indicated in the catalog will be
        strictly adhered to. You must provide the necessary back-up
        documentation (e.g. medical certificate) for your application to
        be considered favorably. In all circumstances, the written
        request, with all the back up documentation, must be received
        before the final exam week.</li>

    <h1>3 University and Departmental Policies</h1>
    <h2>3.1 <font color="#ff0000">Honor Code</font><br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All students are expected to abide by the <a
          href="http://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a>.
        This policy is rigorously enforced. The computer science
        department has an <a
          href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Honor Code
          Policies</a> that you are subject to particularly for our
        course<b>.&nbsp; </b>Cheating on any assignment will be
        prosecuted and result in a notification of the Honor Committee
        as outlined in the GMU Honor Code. <font color="#ff0000">Sharing,




          collaboration, or looking at any code, algorithm, or solutions
          of assignments that is not your own (or outside the group for
          group assignments), including resources from Internet, is
          considered cheating</font>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at
        copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the
        honor code simply will not be tolerated. We use automated
        software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them to find
        the cases that must be submitted to the Office of Academic
        Integrity. The penalty for cheating will always be far worse
        than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance. <b>Confirmed




          cases of cheating almost always translate into course failure

        <li> Due to the size of the class, individual professors and

          accommodations. Even if you don't know whether you plan on
