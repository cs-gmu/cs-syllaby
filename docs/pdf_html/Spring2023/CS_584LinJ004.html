  <dt><b>Prerequisites </b></dt>
</dl>

<ul>

  <li>Formally: Grade of C
or better in CS 310 (Data Structures) and STAT 344 (Probability and
Statistics) or equivalent.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>More specifically: Programming experience in Python preferred.
Experience in Java or C++ will work as well, but the assignments will
  use the Python framework. Students should be familiar with basic probability and
statistics concepts, and linear algebra. Please expect lots of
programming in all the assignments.</li>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Assignments</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be 4-5 competition-style programming assignments. The preferred
  programming language is Python. Competition winners will get 1%
  extra credit added to the final grade.</p>
    <p> </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Exams</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There will be one midterm and one final exam. The final exam is
  comprehensive. Both exams are closed-book, and they must be taken at the scheduled time and
place, unless prior arrangement has been made with the instructor.
Missed exams cannot be made up.</p>
    <p> </p>

  <dt><b>Class Participation</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You will be able to earn class participation credit through
  in-class activities and quizzes. The purpose of the quizzes is to help
  you stay on track of the lecture materials, so they are typically
  short and easier compared to the midterm and final.

<!--  <dt> <b>Project</b></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>There will be one team project in the semester. The project
grade
consists of project proposal (including project pitch, 5% total of
overall course grade), video presentation (5%), and project report and code
(20%).<br>
