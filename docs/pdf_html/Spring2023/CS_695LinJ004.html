  <dt> <b>Course Description</b> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Time series is perhaps the most commonly encountered data type,
  encompassing almost every human endeavor including medicine,
  finance, aerospace, industry, science, etc. The unique
  characteristics of time series data present special challenges to
  researchers and practitioners. As a result, most data mining or machine
  learning algorithms cannot be applied directly on time series. This
  seminar provides an overview on state of the art research from the
  past few decades on mining
  and learning from time series data. Topics covered include data
  representation, similarity search, clustering, classification,
  anomaly detection, rule discoery, motif discovery, and
  visualization. Mining of streaming and spatiotemporal (trajectory)
  data will also be discussed.<br>

<br>
  </dd>

 <dt><b>Course Format</b> </dt>
  <dd>
<p>The course will include lectures by the instructor, presentations
  from students, and class discussion. You will be asked to read

  <dt><b>Grading</b> </dt>
  <dd><br>
Grading will be based on participation, assignments, presentation, and
  a final project. Each week you are required to read two papers
  before class, and submit a paper review. Each student will give a
  30-minute presentation on one paper in the semester. There will be a team project (no midterm oor final). 

  </dd>
  <p>
  <dd>Assignments/paper review: 25%</dd>
  <dd>Presentation: 15%</dd>
  <dd>Project: 50%</dd>
  <dd>Class participation/discussion: 10%</dd>
  </dt>
</dl>

<dt> <b>Project</b></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>There will be one team project in the semester. The project
grade
consists of project proposal (including project pitch, 10% total of
overall course grade), progress report (5%), presentation (10%), and project report and code
(25%).<br>
