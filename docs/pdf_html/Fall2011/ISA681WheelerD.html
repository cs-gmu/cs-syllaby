<h1>Syllabus for SWE 781 001 (70704) / ISA 681 001 (75281) - Fall 2011</h1>
<p>
<i>As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. -- Maurice Wilkes (1949)<br><br></font></i>


<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
GMU Catalog:
"Theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular
on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows,
race conditions and random number generation, and on identification of
potential threats and vulnerabilities early in design cycle. Emphasizes
methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security
vulnerabilities, techniques to prove absence of vulnerabilities, ways
to avoid security holes in new software, and essential guidelines for
building secure software: how to design software with security in mind
from the ground up and integrate analysis and risk management throughout
the software life cycle."

<!--
<p>
This class will provide the theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows, race conditions and random number generation, and on the identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the design cycle. The emphasis is on methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security vulnerabilities, techniques to prove the absence of vulnerabilities, and ways to avoid security holes in new software and on essential guidelines for building secure software: how to design software with security in mind from the ground up and to integrate analysis and risk management throughout the software life cycle.
-->

<p>
People around the world now depend vitally on computers for their health
and well-being.
Unfortunately, vulnerabilities in their software can sometimes be exploited,
resulting in terrible harm.
This class will study how to prevent these vulnerabilities
from being in the software in the first place.
The goal of the class is to prepare you to be able to develop software
with far fewer security vulnerabilities than is typical today, and to
prepare you to help others do the same.

<p>
Do <b>not</b> turn in materials late.  Penalty is
10%/day and they won't be accepted after three days
(except for unexpected health/ family emergencies or <i>special</i> permission).


<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and don't distract others.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate in class, and
if you use a laptop to take notes, please don't surf the net during class
(unless told otherwise).
Talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with class (especially the mid-term exam), e.g.,
a <a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
GMU is an <a href="http://academicintegrity.gmu.edu/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>
university; please see the University Catalog for
a full description of the code and the honor committee process. The
principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations
are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this
course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else's work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance
and clarification.
<b>Do not plagerize.</b>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Students must use their Mason email accounts - either the existing
"MEMO" system or a new "MASONLIVE" account to receive important
University information, including messages related to this class. See
http://masonlive.gmu.edu for more information.
Please use the instructor's email address for class questions.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
please see
me and contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations must be arranged through the ODS.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me).
