<h2>INFS 623: Web Search Engines and Recommender Systems</h2>
<h4>Fall 2011 --- Prof. Ami Motro</h4>
<hr>
<p>
This graduate course covers two hugely popular types of systems: Web search
engines and recommender systems.  Web search engines attempt to locate
information items (e.g., documents, Web pages) based on user specifications.
These systems have developed from traditional systems for bibliogrphic
information retrieval dating back 40 years.  With the exception of Web
browsers, search engines arguably are the most widely-used tool for accessing
information on the Web.  Recommeder systems discover information items (e.g.,
people, products) that are likely to be of interest to users.  This course
will explore both types of systems, underlining their shared principles.
Roughly, two thirds of the course will be devoted to search engines and one
third to recommender systems.

<!--The need to locate information efficiently on the World-Wide-Web has moved the
traditional field of information retrieval (previously confined to
applications such as document retrieval from library collections) to the
center of the stage. This is demonstrated by the simple fact that these days
nearly everyone uses Internet search engines and is thus familiar with
previously obscure IR concepts such keywords, relevance, ranking, search
refinement, etc.  It is worth noting that market capitalization (the "overall 
size of the business") of information retrieval now <em>exceeds</em> that of 
databases!
<p>
This graduate course is an introduction to the area of
information retrieval. This course has been revised and now covers principles
of both <b>Classical information retrieval</b> (e.g., the Boolean and vector
space model, document indexing, ranking, effectiveness measurement) and
<b>Modern information retrieval</b> (e.g., hypertext documents, Internet search
engines, Web crawling, link analysis).
<p>
Roughly speaking, the subject of INFS-623 is <i>complemetary</i>
to the subject of a database management course, such as <a href="http://ise.gmu.edu/~ami/teaching/infs614/infs614.html">INFS-614</a>:
Database Management, or <a href="http://ise.gmu.edu/~ami/teaching/infs760/infs760.html">INFS-760</a>:
Advanced Database Management. Whereas database management is
concerned mainly with storage and retrieval of <em>structured</em>
information, information retrieval is concerned mainly with storage
and retrieval of <em>unstructured</em> information, such as documents
and World-Wide-Web pages.
