<h1>CS 580-004 </h1>
<h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p><h3>Meets</h3> THursday 4:30 pm - 7:10 pm David King Jr. Hall 1006
<b>

<p><h3>Professor</h3> <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/">Zoran Duric.</a>

<p><h3>About the Class</h3>  The course can be roughly divided in two
                parts: (i) Intelligence from computation including
                uninformed and informed search, adverserial search,
                constraint satisfaction, markov decison processes, and
                reinforcement learning; (ii) Intelligence from data
                including probailistic reasoning, and unsupervised and
                supervised machine learning methods.
  
<p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>
CS330 and CS310, no exceptions.

<p><h3>Textbooks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th ed.,
  Russell & Norvig (recommended), Prentice Hall
  <li>Artificial Intelligence, Poole & Mackworth, 2nd ed., Cambridge
  University Press (recommended), available <a href="https://artint.info">online</a>
  </ul>

<p><h3>Software</h3>
We will use Python for homework assignments and projects. AIspace, and AISpace2 (see <a href="https://artint.info">the book page</a>)
 
<p><h3>Course Web Page</h3> We will communicate through
  blackboard. Slides,
  handouts, and assignments will be posted on the blackboard course
  page. We will answer questions on blackboard.

<p><h3>Grading</h3> Grading will be based on a combination of the following factors:
  <ul>
    <li> Projects: 30%
    <li> Homeworks: 10%
<li> Midterm: 25%.
<li> Final: 35%.
</ul>

<P><h3>Honor Code</h3>
The class enforces the <a
  href="https://oai.gmu.edu/full-honor-code-document/">GMU Honor Code</a>, and the <a
  href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">more specific honor code policy</a> special to the Department of Computer Science.  You will be expected to adhere to this code and policy.


<p><h3>Disabilities</h3>If you have a documented learning disability or other condition which may affect academic performance, make sure this documentation is on file with the <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/student/drc">Office of Disability Services</a> and come talk to me about accommodations.

<p><h3>Course Outcomes</h3> 
 
<span class="list">1.</span> A knowledge of basic uninformed and heuristic search techniques. 
<span class="list">2.</span> A knowledge of basic logic or probabilistic reasoning techniques. 
<span class="list">3.</span> A knowledge of basic machine learning techniques. 
<span class="list">4.</span> An ability to implement basic AI methods in Python. 
<span class="list">5.</span> An ability to identify and apply an appropriate AI method to a given problem.
