      <span class="section">Description</span></p><p>
      This course is intended to help students learn to think in the manner
	  necessary to fully grasp the nature and power of the digital world around us.  The
	  early era of the Internet and the personal computer led to the need for 
	  "computer literacy."  Now the changing nature of our global society requires that
	  students learn new ways to think about problems and how to solve them,
	  regardless of students' specific fields of endeavor.  Through this course, 
	  students will explore major issues related to the "big ideas" of
	  computational thinking (namely, <i>Creativity, Abstraction, Data, Algorithms, 
	  Programming, Internet, and Societal Impact</i>), as well as how
	  these issues will impact their future lives.</p><p> 

      <span class="section">Outcomes</span></p><p>

      <span class="section">Grading Policies</span><p>
      </p><ul>
	    <li>
		    Homework is due electronically (via Blackboard) before the start of class on the day it is due.  Unlimited resubmissions within the deadline are allowed, but only the most recent is graded.
		</li>
        <li>
            For grade disputes please contact the grader (the TA in most cases) first. You must initiate a dispute within a week of receiving your grade for the dispute to be considered.
        </li>
		<li>
		    Late work is penalized -10% per day late, up to a maxiumum of 4 days.  Thus, an assignment submitted 2 days late which would have scored an 87 would instead receive a 67.  An assignment submitted during class on the day it is due is considered one day late.  An assignment which is more than 4 days late will not be accepted.  
		</li>
		<li>
			You may be required to show your Mason ID for exams.  A missed exam will result in a zero.
        </li>		    
		<li>
		    Please contact the instructor as soon as possible if there are extenuating circumstances which affect your ability to complete an assignment or exam.
		</li>
		    
  	  </ul>
        
      <span class="section">Honor Code</span><p>
      Any direct contribution from others on an assignment or exam, except where expressly permitted, will 
      be treated as a violation of George Mason's <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/George-Mason-University-Honor-Code-2017-2018-Final.pdf">
      Honor Code</a>.  If someone is caught cheating, they will be referred in an honor code case, which will most likely result in failing the course.  Cheating by copying is often remarkably easy to detect by electronic means, so please do not put yourself at risk by cheating.</p><p>
	  To provide an example of what cannot be done, the following are considered cheating and are not permitted:
	  <ul>
	      <li>Directly using another student's solution to a problem, even if it is from a different semester.
		  <li>Asking a friend for a solution or paying someone for a solution.
		  <li>Searching for a solution in an outside source such as the Internet or a solution manual.
		  <li>Pasting your solutions to a public or semi-public site, including the message forum for this course (except in a private posts to the TAs).
		  <li>Collaborating or copying during exams.
		  <li>Assisting others in any of the above.
	  </ul>
	  By constrast, the following is considered fair game during this course:
	  <ul>
	      <li>Discussing the homework with other students in the class via informal, non-specific approaches to how a problem can be solved (do not share code, however).
		  <li>Getting help from classmates in solving a specific type of bug in a program (as long as it doesn't lead to discussing how the code should be structured).
		  <li>Searching on the Internet for alternate explanations of concepts discussed in class.
	  </ul>
	  When learning to program, the ability to discuss with others is important to gain a footing and to better understand what is going on.  At the same time, solving problems individually helps us better prepare for situation in which there are no other resources to rely on (like exams).  If you are unsure whether something is fair game or cheating, ask an instructor.  A good rule of thumb is that when you submit something, especially a piece of computer code, you should understand it well enough to be able to explain how it works.
      <p>
	  
      <span class="section">Suggestions and additional policies</span></p><p>
	  <ul>
	      <li><i><b>Make backups of all of your work</b></i>. We cannot grade what you do not submit, so guard against the possibility that something happens to your computer or your assignment by saving your work someplace else.  Consider using a cloud backup such as <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.  Accidentally deleting your work is not grounds for an extension.
		  <li>Make sure that your code at least does something.  If your code cannot compile or run due to errors, it is likely to receive little to no credit.
		  <li>Make sure to keep at least one untouched version of each assignment you submit.  If there are issues with the submission, you will only receive credit if we can verify that it has not been modified since you submitted it.
		  <li>It is recommended that you complete each reading assignment before the class where it is shown, to be able to better follow the material.
